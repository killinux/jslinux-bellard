 PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.

10.5 Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules
==========================================

You define an implicit rule by writing a "pattern rule".  A pattern
rule looks like an ordinary rule, except that its target contains the
character `%' (exactly one of them).  The target is considered a
pattern for matching file names; the `%' can match any nonempty
substring, while other characters match only themselves.  The
prerequisites likewise use `%' to show how their names relate to the
target name.

   Thus, a pattern rule `%.o : %.c' says how to make any file `STEM.o'
from another file `STEM.c'.

   Note that expansion using `%' in pattern rules occurs *after* any
variable or function expansions, which take place when the makefile is
read.  *Note How to Use Variables: Using Variables, and *Note Functions

10.5.1 Introduction to Pattern Rules
------------------------------------

A pattern rule contains the character `%' (exactly one of them) in the
target; otherwise, it looks exactly like an ordinary rule.  The target
is a pattern for matching file names; the `%' matches any nonempty
substring, while other characters match only themselves.  

   For example, `%.c' as a pattern matches any file name that ends in
`.c'.  `s.%.c' as a pattern matches any file name that starts with
`s.', ends in `.c' and is at least five characters long.  (There must
be at least one character to match the `%'.)  The substring that the
`%' matches is called the "stem".

   `%' in a prerequisite of a pattern rule stands for the same stem
that was matched by the `%' in the target.  In order for the pattern
rule to apply, its target pattern must match the file name under
consideration and all of its prerequisites (after pattern substitution)
must name files that exist or can be made.  These files become
prerequisites of the target.  

   Thus, a rule of the form

     %.o : %.c ; COMMAND...

specifies how to make a file `N.o', with another file `N.c' as its
prerequisite, provided that `N.c' exists or can be made.

   There may also be prerequisites that do not use `%'; such a
prerequisite attaches to every file made by this pattern rule.  These
unvarying prerequisites are useful occasionally.

   A pattern rule need not have any prerequisites that contain `%', or
in fact any prerequisites at all.  Such a rule is effectively a general
wildcard.  It provides a way to make any file that matches the target
pattern.  *Note Last Resort::.

   Pattern rules may have more than one target.  Unlike normal rules,
this does not act as many different rules with the same prerequisites
and commands.  If a pattern rule has multiple targets, `make' knows that
the rule's commands are responsible for making all of the targets.  The
commands are executed only once to make all the targets.  When searching
for a pattern rule to match a target, the target patterns of a rule
other than the one that matches the target in need of a rule are
incidental: `make' worries only about giving commands and prerequisites
to the file presently in question.  However, when this file's commands
are run, the other targets are marked as having been updated themselves.  

   The order in which pattern rules appear in the makefile is important
since this is the order in which they are considered.  Of equally
applicable rules, only the first one found is used.  The rules you
write take precedence over those that are built in.  Note however, that
a rule whose prerequisites actually exist or are mentioned always takes
priority over a rule with prerequisites that must be made by chaining
other implicit rules.  


File: make.info,  Node: Pattern Examples,  Next: Automatic Variables,  Prev: Pattern Intro,  Up: Pattern Rules

10.5.2 Pattern Rule Examples
----------------------------

Here are some examples of pattern rules actually predefined in `make'.
First, the rule that compiles `.c' files into `.o' files:

     %.o : %.c
             $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $< -o $@

defines a rule that can make any file `X.o' from `X.c'.  The command
uses the automatic variables `$@' and `$<' to substitute the names of
the target file and the source file in each case where the rule applies
(*note Automatic Variables::).

   Here is a second built-in rule:

     % :: RCS/%,v
             $(CO) $(COFLAGS) $<

defines a rule that can make any file `X' whatsoever from a
corresponding file `X,v' in the subdirectory `RCS'.  Since the target
is `%', this rule will apply to any file whatever, provided the
appropriate prerequisite file exists.  The double colon makes the rule
"terminal", which means that its prerequisite may not be an intermediate
file (*note Match-Anything Pattern Rules: Match-Anything Rules.).

   This pattern rule has two targets:

     %.tab.c %.tab.h: %.y
             bison -d $<

This tells `make' that the command `bison -d X.y' will make both
`X.tab.c' and `X.tab.h'.  If the file `foo' depends on the files
`parse.tab.o' and `scan.o' and the file `scan.o' depends on the file
`parse.tab.h', when `parse.y' is changed, the command `bison -d parse.y'
will be executed only once, and the prerequisites of both `parse.tab.o'
and `scan.o' will be satisfied.  (Presumably the file `parse.tab.o'
will be recompiled from `parse.tab.c' and the file `scan.o' from
`scan.c', while `foo' is linked from `parse.tab.o', `scan.o', and its
other prerequisites, and it will execute happily ever after.)

10.5.3 Automatic Variables
--------------------------

Suppose you are writing a pattern rule to compile a `.c' file into a
`.o' file: how do you write the `cc' command so that it operates on the
right source file name?  You cannot write the name in the command,
because the name is different each time the implicit rule is applied.

   What you do is use a special feature of `make', the "automatic
variables".  These variables have values computed afresh for each rule
that is executed, based on the target and prerequisites of the rule.
In this example, you would use `$@' for the object file name and `$<'
for the source file name.

   It's very important that you recognize the limited scope in which
automatic variable values are available: they only have values within
the command script.  In particular, you cannot use them anywhere within
the target list of a rule; they have no value there and will expand to
the empty string.  Also, they cannot be accessed directly within the
prerequisite list of a rule.  A common mistake is attempting to use
`$@' within the prerequisites list; this will not work.  However, there
is a special feature of GNU `make', secondary expansion (*note
Secondary Expansion::), which will allow automatic variable values to
be used in prerequisite lists.

   Here is a table of automatic variables:

`$@'
     The file name of the target of the rule.  If the target is an
     archive member, then `$@' is the name of the archive file.  In a
     pattern rule that has multiple targets (*note Introduction to
     Pattern Rules: Pattern Intro.), `$@' is the name of whichever
     target caused the rule's commands to be run.

`$%'
     The target member name, when the target is an archive member.
     *Note Archives::.  For example, if the target is `foo.a(bar.o)'
     then `$%' is `bar.o' and `$@' is `foo.a'.  `$%' is empty when the
     target is not an archive member.

`$<'
     The name of the first prerequisite.  If the target got its
     commands from an implicit rule, this will be the first
     prerequisite added by the implicit rule (*note Implicit Rules::).

`$?'
     The names of all the prerequisites that are newer than the target,
     with spaces between them.  For prerequisites which are archive
     members, only the member named is used (*note Archives::).  

`$^'
     The names of all the prerequisites, with spaces between them.  For
     prerequisites which are archive members, only the member named is
     used (*note Archives::).  A target has only one prerequisite on
     each other file it depends on, no matter how many times each file
     is listed as a prerequisite.  So if you list a prerequisite more
     than once for a target, the value of `$^' contains just one copy
     of the name.  This list does *not* contain any of the order-only
     prerequisites; for those see the `$|' variable, below.  

`$+'
     This is like `$^', but prerequisites listed more than once are
     duplicated in the order they were listed in the makefile.  This is
     primarily useful for use in linking commands where it is
     meaningful to repeat library file names in a particular order.

`$|'
     The names of all the order-only prerequisites, with spaces between
     them.

`$*'
     The stem with which an implicit rule matches (*note How Patterns
     Match: Pattern Match.).  If the target is `dir/a.foo.b' and the
     target pattern is `a.%.b' then the stem is `dir/foo'.  The stem is
     useful for constructing names of related files.  

     In a static pattern rule, the stem is part of the file name that
     matched the `%' in the target pattern.

     In an explicit rule, there is no stem; so `$*' cannot be determined
     in that way.  Instead, if the target name ends with a recognized
     suffix (*note Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules: Suffix Rules.), `$*' is
     set to the target name minus the suffix.  For example, if the
     target name is `foo.c', then `$*' is set to `foo', since `.c' is a
     suffix.  GNU `make' does this bizarre thing only for compatibility
     with other implementations of `make'.  You should generally avoid
     using `$*' except in implicit rules or static pattern rules.

     If the target name in an explicit rule does not end with a
     recognized suffix, `$*' is set to the empty string for that rule.

   `$?' is useful even in explicit rules when you wish to operate on
only the prerequisites that have changed.  For example, suppose that an
archive named `lib' is supposed to contain copies of several object
files.  This rule copies just the changed object files into the archive:

     lib: fo2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  :  ;  <  =  >  ?  @  A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  K  L  M  N  O  P  Q  R  S  T  U  V  W  X  Y  Z  [  \  ]  ^  _  `  a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  j  k  l  m  n  o  p  q  r  s  t  u  v  w  x  y  z  {  |  }  ~                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              o.o bar.o lose.o win.o
             ar r lib $?

   Of the variables listed above, four have values that are single file
names, and three have values that are lists of file names.  These seven
have variants that get just the file's directory name or just the file
name within the directory.  The variant variables' names are formed by
appending `D' or `F', respectively.  These variants are semi-obsolete
in GNU `make' since the functions `dir' and `notdir' can be used to get
a similar effect (*note Functions for File Names: File Name
Functions.).  Note, however, that the `D' variants all omit the
trailing slash which always appears in the output of the `dir'
function.  Here is a table of the variants:

`$(@D)'
     The directory part of the file name of the target, with the
     trailing slash removed.  If the value of `$@' is `dir/foo.o' then
     `$(@D)' is `dir'.  This value is `.' if `$@' does not contain a
     slash.

`$(@F)'
     The file-within-directory part of the file name of the target.  If
     the value of `$@' is `dir/foo.o' then `$(@F)' is `foo.o'.  `$(@F)'
     is equivalent to `$(notdir $@)'.

`$(*D)'
`$(*F)'
     The directory part and the file-within-directory part of the stem;
     `dir' and `foo' in this example.

`$(%D)'
`$(%F)'
     The directory part and the file-within-directory part of the target
     archive member name.  This makes sense only for archive member
     targets of the form `ARCHIVE(MEMBER)' and is useful only when
     MEMBER may contain a directory name.  (*Note Archive Members as
     Targets: Archive Members.)

`$(<D)'
`$(<F)'
     The directory part and the file-within-directory part of the first
     prerequisite.

`$(^D)'
`$(^F)'
     Lists of the directory parts and the file-within-directory parts
     of all prerequisites.

`$(+D)'
`$(+F)'
     Lists of the directory parts and the file-within-directory parts
     of all prerequisites, including multiple instances of duplicated
     prerequisites.

`$(?D)'
`$(?F)'
     Lists of the directory parts and the file-within-directory parts of
     all prerequisites that are newer than the target.

   Note that we use a special stylistic convention when we talk about
these automatic variables; we write "the value of `$<'", rather than
"the variable `<'" as we would write for ordinary variables such as
`objects' and `CFLAGS'.  We think this convention looks more natural in
this special case.  Please do not assume it has a deep significance;
`$<' refers to the variable named `<' just as `$(CFLAGS)' refers to the
variable named `CFLAGS'.  You could just as well use `$(<)' in place of
`$<'.

10.5.4 How Patterns Match
-------------------------

A target pattern is composed of a `%' between a prefix and a suffix,
either or both of which may be empty.  The pattern matches a file name
only if the file name starts with the prefix and ends with the suffix,
without overlap.  The text between the prefix and the suffix is called
the "stem".  Thus, when the pattern `%.o' matches the file name
`test.o', the stem is `test'.  The pattern rule prerequisites are
turned into actual file names by substituting the stem for the character
`%'.  Thus, if in the same example one of the prerequisites is written
as `%.c', it expands to `test.c'.

   When the target pattern does not contain a slash (and it usually does
not), directory names in the file names are removed from the file name
before it is compared with the target prefix and suffix.  After the
comparison of the file name to the target pattern, the directory names,
along with the slash that ends them, are added on to the prerequisite
file names generated from the pattern rule's prerequisite patterns and
the file name.  The directories are ignored only for the purpose of
finding an implicit rule to use, not in the application of that rule.
Thus, `e%t' matches the file name `src/eat', with `src/a' as the stem.
When prerequisites are turned into file names, the directories from the
stem are added at the front, while the rest of the stem is substituted
for the `%'.  The stem `src/a' with a prerequisite pattern `c%r' gives
the file name `src/car'.

10.5.5 Match-Anything Pattern Rules
-----------------------------------

When a pattern rule's target is just `%', it matches any file name
whatever.  We call these rules "match-anything" rules.  They are very
useful, but it can take a lot of time for `make' to think about them,
because it must consider every such rule for each file name listed
either as a target or as a prerequisite.

   Suppose the makefile mentions `foo.c'.  For this target, `make'
would have to consider making it by linking an object file `foo.c.o',
or by C compilation-and-linking in one step from `foo.c.c', or by
Pascal compilation-and-linking from `foo.c.p', and many other
possibilities.

   We know these possibilities are ridiculous since `foo.c' is a C
source file, not an executable.  If `make' did consider these
possibilities, it would ultimately reject them, because files such as
`foo.c.o' and `foo.c.p' would not exist.  But these possibilities are so
numerous that `make' would run very slowly if it had to consider them.

   To gain speed, we have put various constraints on the way `make'
considers match-anything rules.  There are two different constraints
that can be applied, and each time you define a match-anything rule you
must choose one or the other for that rule.

   One choice is to mark the match-anything rule as "terminal" by
defining it with a double colon.  When a rule is terminal, it does not
apply unless its prerequisites actually exist.  Prerequisites that
could be made with other implicit rules are not good enough.  In other
words, no further chaining is allowed beyond a terminal rule.

   For example, the built-in implicit rules for extracting sources from
RCS and SCCS files are terminal; as a result, if the file `foo.c,v' does
not exist, `make' will not even consider trying to make it as an
intermediate file from `foo.c,v.o' or from `RCS/SCCS/s.foo.c,v'.  RCS
and SCCS files are generally ultimate source files, which should not be
remade from any other files; therefore, `make' can save time by not
looking for ways to remake them.

   If you do not mark the match-anything rule as terminal, then it is
nonterminal.  A nonterminal match-anything rule cannot apply to a file
name that indicates a specific type of data.  A file name indicates a
specific type of data if some non-match-anything implicit rule target
matches it.

   For example, the file name `foo.c' matches the target for the pattern
rule `%.c : %.y' (the rule to run Yacc).  Regardless of whether this
rule is actually applicable (which happens only if there is a file
`foo.y'), the fact that its target matches is enough to prevent
consideration of any nonterminal match-anything rules for the file
`foo.c'.  Thus, `make' will not even consider trying to make `foo.c' as
an executable file from `foo.c.o', `foo.c.c', `foo.c.p', etc.

   The motivation for this constraint is that nonterminal match-anything
rules are used for making files containing specific types of data (such
as executable files) and a file name with a recognized suffix indicates
some other specific type of data (such as a C source file).

   Special built-in dummy pattern rules are provided solely to recognize
certain file names so that nonterminal match-anything rules will not be
considered.  These dummy rules have no prerequisites and no commands,
and they are ignored for all other purposes.  For example, the built-in
implicit rule

     %.p :

exists to make sure that Pascal source files such as `foo.p' match a
specific target pattern and thereby prevent time from being wasted
looking for `foo.p.o' or `foo.p.c'.

   Dummy pattern rules such as the one for `%.p' are made for every
suffix listed as valid for use in suffix rules (*note Old-Fashioned
Suffix Rules: Suffix Rules.).

10.5.6 Canceling Implicit Rules
-------------------------------

You can override a built-in implicit rule (or one you have defined
yourself) by defining a new pattern rule with the same target and
prerequisites, but different commands.  When the new rule is defined,
the built-in one is replaced.  The new rule's position in the sequence
of implicit rules is determined by where you write the new rule.

   You can cancel a built-in implicit rule by defining a pattern rule
with the same target and prerequisites, but no commands.  For example,
the following would cancel the rule that runs the assembler:

     %.o : %.s

10.6 Defining Last-Resort Default Rules
=======================================

You can define a last-resort implicit rule by writing a terminal
match-anything pattern rule with no prerequisites (*note Match-Anything
Rules::).  This is just like any other pattern rule; the only thing
special about it is that it will match any target.  So such a rule's
commands are used for all targets and prerequisites that have no
commands of their own and for which no other implicit rule applies.

   For example, when testing a makefile, you might not care if the
source files contain real data, only that they exist.  Then you might
do this:

     %::
             touch $@

to cause all the source files needed (as prerequisites) to be created
automatically.

   You can instead define commands to be used for targets for which
there are no rules at all, even ones which don't specify commands.  You
do this by writing a rule for the target `.DEFAULT'.  Such a rule's
commands are used for all prerequisites which do not appear as targets
in any explicit rule, and for which no implicit rule applies.
Naturally, there is no `.DEFAULT' rule unless you write one.

   If you use `.DEFAULT' with no commands or prerequisites:

     .DEFAULT:

the commands previously stored for `.DEFAULT' are cleared.  Then `make'
acts as if you had never defined `.DEFAULT' at all.

   If you do not want a target to get the commands from a match-anything
pattern rule or `.DEFAULT', but you also do not want any commands to be
run for the target, you can give it empty commands (*note Defining
Empty Commands: Empty Commands.).

   You can use a last-resort rule to override part of another makefile.

10.7 Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules
===============================

"Suffix rules" are the old-fashioned way of defining implicit rules for
`make'.  Suffix rules are obsolete because pattern rules are more
general and clearer.  They are supported in GNU `make' for
compatibility with old makefiles.  They come in two kinds:
"double-suffix" and "single-suffix".

   A double-suffix rule is defined by a pair of suffixes: the target
suffix and the source suffix.  It matches any file whose name ends with
the target suffix.  The corresponding implicit prerequisite is made by
replacing the target suffix with the source suffix in the file name.  A
two-suffix rule whose target and source suffixes are `.o' and `.c' is
equivalent to the pattern rule `%.o : %.c'.

   A single-suffix rule is defined by a single suffix, which is the
source suffix.  It matches any file name, and the corresponding implicit
prerequisite name is made by appending the source suffix.  A
single-suffix rule whose source suffix is `.c' is equivalent to the
pattern rule `% : %.c'.

   Suffix rule definitions are recognized by comparing each rule's
target against a defined list of known suffixes.  When `make' sees a
rule whose target is a known suffix, this rule is considered a
single-suffix rule.  When `make' sees a rule whose target is two known
suffixes concatenated, this rule is taken as a double-suffix rule.

   For example, `.c' and `.o' are both on the default list of known
suffixes.  Therefore, if you define a rule whose target is `.c.o',
`make' takes it to be a double-suffix rule with source suffix `.c' and
target suffix `.o'.  Here is the old-fashioned way to define the rule
for compiling a C source file:

     .c.o:
             $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -o $@ $<

   Suffix rules cannot have any prerequisites of their own.  If they
have any, they are treated as normal files with funny names, not as
suffix rules.  Thus, the rule:

     .c.o: foo.h
             $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -o $@ $<

tells how to make the file `.c.o' from the prerequisite file `foo.h',
and is not at all like the pattern rule:

     %.o: %.c foo.h
             $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -o $@ $<

which tells how to make `.o' files from `.c' files, and makes all `.o'
files using this pattern rule also depend on `foo.h'.

   Suffix rules with no commands are also meaningless.  They do not
remove previous rules as do pattern rules with no commands (*note
Canceling Implicit Rules: Canceling Rules.).  They simply enter the
suffix or pair of suffixes concatenated as a target in the data base.

   The known suffixes are simply the names of the prerequisites of the
special target `.SUFFIXES'.  You can add your own suffixes by writing a
rule for `.SUFFIXES' that adds more prerequisites, as in:

     .SUFFIXES: .hack .win

which adds `.hack' and `.win' to the end of the list of suffixes.

   If you wish to eliminate the default known suffixes instead of just
adding to them, write a rule for `.SUFFIXES' with no prerequisites.  By
special dispensation, this eliminates all existing prerequisites of
`.SUFFIXES'.  You can then write another rule to add the suffixes you
want.  For example,

     .SUFFIXES:            # Delete the default suffixes
     .SUFFIXES: .c .o .h   # Define our suffix list

   The `-r' or `--no-builtin-rules' flag causes the default list of
suffixes to be empty.

   The variable `SUFFIXES' is defined to the default list of suffixes
before `make' reads any makefiles.  You can change the list of suffixes
