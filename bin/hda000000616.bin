     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.

1 Programming Languages Supported by GCC
****************************************

GCC stands for "GNU Compiler Collection".  GCC is an integrated
distribution of compilers for several major programming languages.
These languages currently include C, C++, Objective-C, Objective-C++,
Java, Fortran, and Ada.

 The abbreviation "GCC" has multiple meanings in common use.  The
current official meaning is "GNU Compiler Collection", which refers
generically to the complete suite of tools.  The name historically stood
for "GNU C Compiler", and this usage is still common when the emphasis
is on compiling C programs.  Finally, the name is also used when
speaking of the "language-independent" component of GCC: code shared
among the compilers for all supported languages.

 The language-independent component of GCC includes the majority of the
optimizers, as well as the "back ends" that generate machine code for
various processors.

 The part of a compiler that is specific to a particular language is
called the "front end".  In addition to the front ends that are
integrated components of GCC, there are several other front ends that
are maintained separately.  These support languages such as Pascal,
Mercury, and COBOL.  To use these, they must be built together with GCC
proper.

 Most of the compilers for languages other than C have their own names.
The C++ compiler is G++, the Ada compiler is GNAT, and so on.  When we
talk about compiling one of those languages, we might refer to that
compiler by its own name, or as GCC.  Either is correct.

 Historically, compilers for many languages, including C++ and Fortran,
have been implemented as "preprocessors" which emit another high level
language such as C.  None of the compilers included in GCC are
implemented this way; they all generate machine code directly.  This
sort of preprocessor should not be confused with the "C preprocessor",
which is an integral feature of the C, C++, Objective-C and
Objective-C++ languages.

2 Language Standards Supported by GCC
*************************************

For each language compiled by GCC for which there is a standard, GCC
attempts to follow one or more versions of that standard, possibly with
some exceptions, and possibly with some extensions.

2.1 C language
==============

GCC supports three versions of the C standard, although support for the
most recent version is not yet complete.

 The original ANSI C standard (X3.159-1989) was ratified in 1989 and
published in 1990.  This standard was ratified as an ISO standard
(ISO/IEC 9899:1990) later in 1990.  There were no technical differences
between these publications, although the sections of the ANSI standard
were renumbered and became clauses in the ISO standard.  This standard,
in both its forms, is commonly known as "C89", or occasionally as
"C90", from the dates of ratification.  The ANSI standard, but not the
ISO standard, also came with a Rationale document.  To select this
standard in GCC, use one of the options `-ansi', `-std=c89' or
`-std=iso9899:1990'; to obtain all the diagnostics required by the
standard, you should also specify `-pedantic' (or `-pedantic-errors' if
you want them to be errors rather than warnings).  *Note Options
Controlling C Dialect: C Dialect Options.

 Errors in the 1990 ISO C standard were corrected in two Technical
Corrigenda published in 1994 and 1996.  GCC does not support the
uncorrected version.

 An amendment to the 1990 standard was published in 1995.  This
amendment added digraphs and `__STDC_VERSION__' to the language, but
otherwise concerned the library.  This amendment is commonly known as
"AMD1"; the amended standard is sometimes known as "C94" or "C95".  To
select this standard in GCC, use the option `-std=iso9899:199409'
(with, as for other standard versions, `-pedantic' to receive all
required diagnostics).

 A new edition of the ISO C standard was published in 1999 as ISO/IEC
9899:1999, and is commonly known as "C99".  GCC has incomplete support
for this standard version; see
`http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.3/c99status.html' for details.  To select this
standard, use `-std=c99' or `-std=iso9899:1999'.  (While in
development, drafts of this standard version were referred to as "C9X".)

 Errors in the 1999 ISO C standard were corrected in three Technical
Corrigenda published in 2001, 2004 and 2007.  GCC does not support the
uncorrected version.

 By default, GCC provides some extensions to the C language that on
rare occasions conflict with the C standard.  *Note Extensions to the C
Language Family: C Extensions.  Use of the `-std' options listed above
will disable these extensions where they conflict with the C standard
version selected.  You may also select an extended version of the C
language explicitly with `-std=gnu89' (for C89 with GNU extensions) or
`-std=gnu99' (for C99 with GNU extensions).  The default, if no C
language dialect options are given, is `-std=gnu89'; this will change to
`-std=gnu99' in some future release when the C99 support is complete.
Some features that are part of the C99 standard are accepted as
extensions in C89 mode.

 The ISO C standard defines (in clause 4) two classes of conforming
implementation.  A "conforming hosted implementation" supports the
whole standard including all the library facilities; a "conforming
freestanding implementation" is only required to provide certain
library facilities: those in `<float.h>', `<limits.h>', `<stdarg.h>',
and `<stddef.h>'; since AMD1, also those in `<iso646.h>'; and in C99,
also those in `<stdbool.h>' and `<stdint.h>'.  In addition, complex
types, added in C99, are not required for freestanding implementations.
The standard also defines two environments for programs, a
"freestanding environment", required of all implementations and which
may not have library facilities beyond those required of freestanding
implementations, where the handling of program startup and termination
are implementation-defined, and a "hosted environment", which is not
required, in which all the library facilities are provided and startup
is through a function `int main (void)' or `int main (int, char *[])'.
An OS kernel would be a freestanding environment; a program using the
facilities of an operating system would normally be in a hosted
implementation.

 GCC aims towards being usable as a conforming freestanding
implementation, or as the compiler for a conforming hosted
implementation.  By default, it will act as the compiler for a hosted
implementation, defining `__STDC_HOSTED__' as `1' and presuming that
when the names of ISO C functions are used, they have the semantics
defined in the standard.  To make it act as a conforming freestanding
implementation for a freestanding environment, use the option
`-ffreestanding'; it will then define `__STDC_HOSTED__' to `0' and not
make assumptions about the meanings of function names from the standard
library, with exceptions noted below.  To build an OS kernel, you may
well still need to make your own arrangements for linking and startup.
*Note Options Controlling C Dialect: C Dialect Options.

 GCC does not provide the library facilities required only of hosted
implementations, nor yet all the facilities required by C99 of
freestanding implementations; to use the facilities of a hosted
environment, you will need to find them elsewhere (for example, in the
GNU C library).  *Note Standard Libraries: Standard Libraries.

 Most of the compiler support routines used by GCC are present in
`libgcc', but there are a few exceptions.  GCC requires the
freestanding environment provide `memcpy', `memmove', `memset' and
`memcmp'.  Finally, if `__builtin_trap' is used, and the target does
not implement the `trap' pattern, then GCC will emit a call to `abort'.

information concerning the history of C that is available online, see
`http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html'

2.2 C++ language
================

GCC supports the ISO C++ standard (1998) and contains experimental
support for the upcoming ISO C++ standard (200x).

 The original ISO C++ standard was published as the ISO standard
(ISO/IEC 14882:1998) and amended by a Technical Corrigenda published in
2003 (I'ö  (ö  )ö  *ö  +ö  ,ö  -ö  .ö  /ö  0ö  1ö  2ö  3ö  4ö  5ö  6ö  7ö  8ö  9ö  :ö  ;ö  <ö  =ö  >ö  ?ö  @ö  Aö  Bö  Cö  Dö  Eö  Fö  Gö  Hö  Iö  Jö  Kö  Lö  Mö  Nö  Oö  Pö  Qö  Rö  Sö  Tö  Uö  Vö  Wö  Xö  Yö  Zö  [ö  \ö  ]ö  ^ö  _ö  `ö  aö  bö  cö  dö  eö  fö  gö  hö  iö  jö  kö  lö  mö  nö  oö  pö  qö  rö  sö  tö  uö  vö  wö  xö  yö  zö  {ö  |ö  }ö  ~ö  ö  Äö  Åö  Çö  Éö  Ñö  Öö  Üö  áö  àö  âö  äö  ãö  åö  çö  éö  èö  êö  ëö  íö  ìö  îö  ïö  ñö  óö  òö  ôö  öö  õö  úö  ùö  ûö  üö  †ö  °ö  ¢ö  £ö  §ö  •ö  ¶ö  ßö  ®ö  ©ö  ™ö  ´ö  ¨ö  ≠ö  Æö  Øö  ∞ö  ±ö  ≤ö  ≥ö  ¥ö  µö  ∂ö  ∑ö  ∏ö  πö  ∫ö  ªö  ºö  Ωö  æö  øö  ¿ö  ¡ö  ¬ö  √ö  ƒö  ≈ö  ∆ö  «ö  »ö  …ö   ö  Àö  Ãö  Õö  Œö  œö  –ö  —ö  “ö  ”ö  ‘ö  ’ö  ÷ö  ◊ö  ÿö  Ÿö  ⁄ö  €ö  ‹ö  ›ö  ﬁö  ﬂö  ‡ö  ·ö  ‚ö  „ö  ‰ö  Âö  Êö  Áö  Ëö  Èö  Íö  Îö  Ïö  Ìö  Óö  Ôö  ö  Òö  Úö  Ûö  Ùö  ıö  ˆö  ˜ö  ¯ö  ˘ö  ˙ö  ˚ö  ¸ö  ˝ö  ˛ö  ˇö   õ  õ  õ  õ  õ  õ  õ  õ  õ  	õ  

C++03, respectively. GCC implements the majority of C++98 (`export' is
a notable exception) and most of the changes in C++03.  To select this
standard in GCC, use one of the options `-ansi' or `-std=c++98'; to
obtain all the diagnostics required by the standard, you should also
specify `-pedantic' (or `-pedantic-errors' if you want them to be
errors rather than warnings).

 The ISO C++ committee is working on a new ISO C++ standard, dubbed
C++0x, that is intended to be published by 2009. C++0x contains several
changes to the C++ language, some of which have been implemented in an
experimental C++0x mode in GCC. The C++0x mode in GCC tracks the draft
working paper for the C++0x standard; the latest working paper is
available on the ISO C++ committee's web site at
`http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/'. For information regarding
the C++0x features available in the experimental C++0x mode, see
`http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.3/cxx0x_status.html'. To select this standard
in GCC, use the option `-std=c++0x'; to obtain all the diagnostics
required by the standard, you should also specify `-pedantic' (or
`-pedantic-errors' if you want them to be errors rather than warnings).

 By default, GCC provides some extensions to the C++ language; *Note
Options Controlling C++ Dialect: C++ Dialect Options.  Use of the
`-std' option listed above will disable these extensions.  You may also
select an extended version of the C++ language explicitly with
`-std=gnu++98' (for C++98 with GNU extensions) or `-std=gnu++0x' (for
C++0x with GNU extensions).  The default, if no C++ language dialect
options are given, is `-std=gnu++98'.

2.3 Objective-C and Objective-C++ languages
===========================================

There is no formal written standard for Objective-C or Objective-C++.
The most authoritative manual is "Object-Oriented Programming and the
Objective-C Language", available at a number of web sites:

   *
     `http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/'
     is a recent (and periodically updated) version;

   * `http://www.toodarkpark.org/computers/objc/' is an older example;

   * `http://www.gnustep.org' and `http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html'
     have additional useful information.

2.4 Treelang language
=====================

There is no standard for treelang, which is a sample language front end
for GCC.  Its only purpose is as a sample for people wishing to write a
new language for GCC.  The language is documented in
`gcc/treelang/treelang.texi' which can be turned into info or HTML
format.

 *Note GNAT Reference Manual: (gnat_rm)Top, for information on standard
conformance and compatibility of the Ada compiler.

 *Note Standards: (gfortran)Standards, for details of standards
supported by GNU Fortran.

 *Note Compatibility with the Java Platform: (gcj)Compatibility, for
details of compatibility between `gcj' and the Java Platform.

3 GCC Command Options
*********************

When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation,
assembly and linking.  The "overall options" allow you to stop this
process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the `-c' option says
not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files output
by the assembler.

 Other options are passed on to one stage of processing.  Some options
control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.  Yet other
options control the assembler and linker; most of these are not
documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.

 Most of the command line options that you can use with GCC are useful
for C programs; when an option is only useful with another language
(usually C++), the explanation says so explicitly.  If the description
for a particular option does not mention a source language, you can use
that option with all supported languages.

 *Note Compiling C++ Programs: Invoking G++, for a summary of special
options for compiling C++ programs.

 The `gcc' program accepts options and file names as operands.  Many
options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter
options may _not_ be grouped: `-dr' is very different from `-d -r'.

 You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the order
you use doesn't matter.  Order does matter when you use several options
of the same kind; for example, if you specify `-L' more than once, the
directories are searched in the order specified.  Also, the placement
of the `-l' option is significant.

 Many options have long names starting with `-f' or with `-W'--for
example, `-fmove-loop-invariants', `-Wformat' and so on.  Most of these
have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of `-ffoo'
would be `-fno-foo'.  This manual documents only one of these two
forms, whichever one is not the default.
