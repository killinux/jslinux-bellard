.IX Item "-fschedule-insns"
If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder instructions to
eliminate execution stalls due to required data being unavailable.  This
helps machines that have slow floating point or memory load instructions
by allowing other instructions to be issued until the result of the load

.IP "\fB\-fschedule\-insns2\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fschedule-insns2"
Similar to \fB\-fschedule\-insns\fR, but requests an additional pass of
instruction scheduling after register allocation has been done.  This is

.IX Item "-fsched2-use-superblocks"
When scheduling after register allocation, do use superblock scheduling
algorithm.  Superblock scheduling allows motion across basic block boundaries
resulting on faster schedules.  This option is experimental, as not all machine
descriptions used by \s-1GCC\s0 model the \s-1CPU\s0 closely enough to avoid unreliable
results from the algorithm.

Use \fB\-fsched2\-use\-superblocks\fR algorithm when scheduling after register
allocation and additionally perform code duplication in order to increase the

This mode should produce faster but significantly longer programs.  Also
without \fB\-fbranch\-probabilities\fR the traces constructed may not

.IX Item "-fcaller-saves"
Enable values to be allocated in registers that will be clobbered by
function calls, by emitting extra instructions to save and restore the

This option is always enabled by default on certain machines, usually
those which have no call-preserved registers to use instead.

.IP "\fB\-ftree\-fre\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-fre"
Perform full redundancy elimination (\s-1FRE\s0) on trees.  The difference
between \s-1FRE\s0 and \s-1PRE\s0 is that \s-1FRE\s0 only considers expressions
that are computed on all paths leading to the redundant computation.
This analysis is faster than \s-1PRE\s0, though it exposes fewer redundancies.
This flag is enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-copy\-prop\fR" 4

Perform structure reorganization optimization, that change C\-like structures 
layout in order to better utilize spatial locality.  This transformation is 
affective for programs containing arrays of structures.  Available in two 
compilation modes: profile-based (enabled with \fB\-fprofile\-generate\fR)
or static (which uses built-in heuristics).  Require \fB\-fipa\-type\-escape\fR
to provide the safety of this transformation.  It works only in whole program
mode, so it requires \fB\-fwhole\-program\fR and \fB\-combine\fR to be
enabled.  Structures considered \fBcold\fR by this transformation are not
affected (see \fB\-\-param struct\-reorg\-cold\-struct\-ratio=\fR\fIvalue\fR).

With this flag, the program debug info reflects a new structure layout.

.IX Item "-fipa-pta"
Perform interprocedural pointer analysis.
.IP "\fB\-fipa\-cp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fipa-cp"
Perform interprocedural constant propagation.
This optimization analyzes the program to determine when values passed
to functions are constants and then optimizes accordingly.  
This optimization can substantially increase performance
if the application has constants passed to functions, but
because this optimization can create multiple copies of functions,
it may significantly increase code size.
.IP "\fB\-fipa\-matrix\-reorg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fipa-matrix-reorg"
Perform matrix flattening and transposing.
Matrix flattening tries to replace a m\-dimensional matrix 
with its equivalent n\-dimensional matrix, where n < m.
This reduces the level of indirection needed for accessing the elements
of the matrix. The second optimization is matrix transposing that
attemps to change the order of the matrix's dimensions in order to 
improve cache locality.
Both optimizations need fwhole-program flag. 
Transposing is enabled only if profiling information is avaliable.

at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-store\-ccp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-store-ccp"
Perform sparse conditional constant propagation (\s-1CCP\s0) on trees.  This

.IP "\fB\-ftree\-dominator\-opts\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-dominator-opts"
Perform a variety of simple scalar cleanups (constant/copy
propagation, redundancy elimination, range propagation and expression
simplification) based on a dominator tree traversal.  This also
performs jump threading (to reduce jumps to jumps). This flag is
enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-dse\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-dse"
Perform dead store elimination (\s-1DSE\s0) on trees.  A dead store is a store into
a memory location which will later be overwritten by another store without
any intervening loads.  In this case the earlier store can be deleted.  This
flag is enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-ch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-ch"
Perform loop header copying on trees.  This is beneficial since it increases
effectiveness of code motion optimizations.  It also saves one jump.  This flag
is enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.  It is not enabled
for \fB\-Os\fR, since it usually increases code size.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-loop\-optimize\fR" 4

Compare the results of several data dependence analyzers.  This option
is used for debugging the data dependence analyzers.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-loop\-im\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-loop-im"
Perform loop invariant motion on trees.  This pass moves only invariants that
would be hard to handle at \s-1RTL\s0 level (function calls, operations that expand to
nontrivial sequences of insns).  With \fB\-funswitch\-loops\fR it also moves
operands of conditions that are invariant out of the loop, so that we can use
just trivial invariantness analysis in loop unswitching.  The pass also includes
store motion.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-loop\-ivcanon\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-loop-ivcanon"
Create a canonical counter for number of iterations in the loop for that
determining number of iterations requires complicated analysis.  Later
optimizations then may determine the number easily.  Useful especially
in connection with unrolling.
.IP "\fB\-fivopts\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fivopts"
Perform induction variable optimizations (strength reduction, induction
variable merging and induction variable elimination) on trees.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-parallelize\-loops=n\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-parallelize-loops=n"
Parallelize loops, i.e., split their iteration space to run in n threads.
This is only possible for loops whose iterations are independent
and can be arbitrarily reordered.  The optimization is only
profitable on multiprocessor machines, for loops that are CPU-intensive,
rather than constrained e.g. by memory bandwidth.  This option
implies \fB\-pthread\fR, and thus is only supported on targets
that have support for \fB\-pthread\fR.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-sra\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-sra"
Perform scalar replacement of aggregates.  This pass replaces structure
references with scalars to prevent committing structures to memory too
early.  This flag is enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-copyrename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-copyrename"
Perform copy renaming on trees.  This pass attempts to rename compiler
temporaries to other variables at copy locations, usually resulting in
variable names which more closely resemble the original variables.  This flag
is enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-ter\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-ter"
Perform temporary expression replacement during the \s-1SSA\-\s0>normal phase.  Single
use/single def temporaries are replaced at their use location with their
defining expression.  This results in non-GIMPLE code, but gives the expanders
much more complex trees to work on resulting in better \s-1RTL\s0 generation.  This is
enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-vectorize\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-vectorize"
Perform loop vectorization on trees. This flag is enabled by default at
\&\fB\-O3\fR.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-vect\-loop\-version\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-vect-loop-version"
Perform loop versioning when doing loop vectorization on trees.  When a loop
appears to be vectorizable except that data alignment or data dependence cannot
be determined at compile time then vectorized and non-vectorized versions of
the loop are generated along with runtime checks for alignment or dependence
to control which version is executed.  This option is enabled by default
except at level \fB\-Os\fR where it is disabled.
.IP "\fB\-fvect\-cost\-model\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvect-cost-model"
Enable cost model for vectorization.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-vrp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-vrp"
Perform Value Range Propagation on trees.  This is similar to the
constant propagation pass, but instead of values, ranges of values are
propagated.  This allows the optimizers to remove unnecessary range
checks like array bound checks and null pointer checks.  This is
enabled by default at \fB\-O2\fR and higher.  Null pointer check
elimination is only done if \fB\-fdelete\-null\-pointer\-checks\fR is
enabled.
.IP "\fB\-ftracer\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftracer"
Perform tail duplication to enlarge superblock size.  This transformation
simplifies the control flow of the function allowing other optimizations to do
better job.
.IP "\fB\-funroll\-loops\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funroll-loops"
Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile
time or upon entry to the loop.  \fB\-funroll\-loops\fR implies
\&\fB\-frerun\-cse\-after\-loop\fR.  This option makes code larger,
and may or may not make it run faster.
.IP "\fB\-funroll\-all\-loops\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funroll-all-loops"
Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is uncertain when
the loop is entered.  This usually makes programs run more slowly.
\&\fB\-funroll\-all\-loops\fR implies the same options as
\&\fB\-funroll\-loops\fR,
.IP "\fB\-fsplit\-ivs\-in\-unroller\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsplit-ivs-in-unroller"
Enables expressing of values of induction variables in later iterations
of the unrolled loop using the value in the first iteration.  This breaks
long dependency chains, thus improving efficiency of the scheduling passes.
.Sp
Combination of \fB\-fweb\fR and \s-1CSE\s0 is often sufficient to obtain the
same effect.  However in cases the loop body is more complicated than
a single basic block, this is not reliable.  It also does not work at all
on some of the architectures due to restrictions in the \s-1CSE\s0 pass.
.Sp
This optimization is enabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-fvariable\-expansion\-in\-unroller\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvariable-expansion-in-unroller"
With this option, the compiler will create multiple copies of some
local variables when unrolling a loop which can result in superior code.

This option is enabled at level \fB\-O3\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fprefetch\-loop\-arrays\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fprefetch-loop-arrays"
If supported by the target machine, generate instructions to prefetch
memory to improve the performance of loops that access large arrays.

.IX Item "-fno-guess-branch-probability"
Do not guess branch probabilities using heuristics.
.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 will use heuristics to guess branch probabilities if they are
not provided by profiling feedback (\fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR).  These
heuristics are based on the control flow graph.  If some branch probabilities
are specified by \fB_\|_builtin_expect\fR, then the heuristics will be
used to guess branch probabilities for the rest of the control flow graph,
taking the \fB_\|_builtin_expect\fR info into account.  The interactions
between the heuristics and \fB_\|_builtin_expect\fR can be complex, and in
some cases, it may be useful to disable the heuristics so that the effects
of \fB_\|_builtin_expect\fR are easier to understand.

.IX Item "-freorder-blocks-and-partition"
In addition to reordering basic blocks in the compiled function, in order
to reduce number of taken branches, partitions hot and cold basic blocks
into separate sections of the assembly and .o files, to improve
paging and cache locality performance.
.Sp
This optimization is automatically turned off in the presence of
exception handling, for linkonce sections, for functions with a user-defined
section attribute and on any architecture that does not support named
sections.
.IP "\fB\-freorder\-functions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-freorder-functions"
Reorder functions in the object file in order to
improve code locality.  This is implemented by using special
subsections \f(CW\*(C`.text.hot\*(C'\fR for most frequently executed functions and
\&\f(CW\*(C`.text.unlikely\*(C'\fR for unlikely executed functions.  Reordering is done by
the linker so object file format must support named sections and linker must
place them in a reasonable way.
.Sp
Also profile feedback must be available in to make this option effective.  See
\&\fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR for details.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstrict-aliasing"
Allows the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules applicable to
the language being compiled.  For C (and \*(C+), this activates
optimizations based on the type of expressions.  In particular, an
object of one type is assumed never to reside at the same address as an
object of a different type, unless the types are almost the same.  For
example, an \f(CW\*(C`unsigned int\*(C'\fR can alias an \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR, but not a
\&\f(CW\*(C`void*\*(C'\fR or a \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR.  A character type may alias any other
type.
.Sp
Pay special attention to code like this:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        union a_union {
\&          int i;
\&          double d;
\&        };
\&        
\&        int f() {
\&          a_union t;
\&          t.d = 3.0;
\&          return t.i;
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
The practice of reading from a different union member than the one most
recently written to (called \*(L"type-punning\*(R") is common.  Even with
\&\fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR, type-punning is allowed, provided the memory
is accessed through the union type.  So, the code above will work as
expected.    However, this code might not:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&        int f() {
\&          a_union t;
\&          int* ip;
\&          t.d = 3.0;
\&          ip = &t.i;
\&          return *ip;
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
Similarly, access by taking the address, casting the resulting pointer
and dereferencing the result has undefined behavior, even if the cast
uses a union type, e.g.:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        int f() {
\&          double d = 3.0;
\&          return ((union a_union *) &d)\->i;
\&        }
.Ve

The \fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR option is enabled at levels
\&\fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fstrict\-overflow\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstrict-overflow"
Allow the compiler to assume strict signed overflow rules, depending
on the language being compiled.  For C (and \*(C+) this means that
overflow when doing arithmetic with signed numbers is undefined, which
means that the compiler may assume that it will not happen.  This
permits various optimizations.  For example, the compiler will assume
that an expression like \f(CW\*(C`i + 10 > i\*(C'\fR will always be true for
signed \f(CW\*(C`i\*(C'\fR.  This assumption is only valid if signed overflow is
undefined, as the expression is false if \f(CW\*(C`i + 10\*(C'\fR overflows when
using twos complement arithmetic.  When this option is in effect any
attempt to determine whether an operation on signed numbers will
overflow must be written carefully to not actually involve overflow.
.Sp
This option also allows the compiler to assume strict pointer
semantics: given a pointer to an object, if adding an offset to that
pointer does not produce a pointer to the same object, the addition is
undefined.  This permits the compiler to conclude that \f(CW\*(C`p + u >
p\*(C'\fR is always true for a pointer \f(CW\*(C`p\*(C'\fR and unsigned integer
\&\f(CW\*(C`u\*(C'\fR.  This assumption is only valid because pointer wraparound is
undefined, as the expression is false if \f(CW\*(C`p + u\*(C'\fR overflows using
twos complement arithmetic.
.Sp
See also the \fB\-fwrapv\fR option.  Using \fB\-fwrapv\fR means
that integer signed overflow is fully defined: it wraps.  When
\&\fB\-fwrapv\fR is used, there is no difference between
\&\fB\-fstrict\-overflow\fR and \fB\-fno\-strict\-overflow\fR for
integers.  With \fB\-fwrapv\fR certain types of overflow are
permitted.  For example, if the compiler gets an overflow when doing
arithmetic on constants, the overflowed value can still be used with
\&\fB\-fwrapv\fR, but not otherwise.

.IP "\fB\-funit\-at\-a\-time\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funit-at-a-time"
Parse the whole compilation unit before starting to produce code.
This allows some extra optimizations to take place but consumes
more memory (in general).  There are some compatibility issues
with \fIunit-at-a-time\fR mode:
.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 4
enabling \fIunit-at-a-time\fR mode may change the order
in which functions, variables, and top-level \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR statements
are emitted, and will likely break code relying on some particular
ordering.  The majority of such top-level \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR statements,
though, can be replaced by \f(CW\*(C`section\*(C'\fR attributes.  The
\&\fBfno-toplevel-reorder\fR option may be used to keep the ordering
used in the input file, at the cost of some optimizations.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fIunit-at-a-time\fR mode removes unreferenced static variables
and functions.  This may result in undefined references
when an \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR statement refers directly to variables or functions
that are otherwise unused.  In that case either the variable/function
shall be listed as an operand of the \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR statement operand or,
in the case of top-level \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR statements the attribute \f(CW\*(C`used\*(C'\fR
shall be used on the declaration.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Static functions now can use non-standard passing conventions that
may break \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR statements calling functions directly.  Again,
attribute \f(CW\*(C`used\*(C'\fR will prevent this behavior.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
As a temporary workaround, \fB\-fno\-unit\-at\-a\-time\fR can be used,
but this scheme may not be supported by future releases of \s-1GCC\s0.

.RE
.IP "\fB\-fno\-toplevel\-reorder\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-toplevel-reorder"
Do not reorder top-level functions, variables, and \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR
statements.  Output them in the same order that they appear in the
input file.  When this option is used, unreferenced static variables
will not be removed.  This option is intended to support existing code
which relies on a particular ordering.  For new code, it is better to
use attributes.
.IP "\fB\-fweb\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fweb"
Constructs webs as commonly used for register allocation purposes and assign
each web individual pseudo register.  This allows the register allocation pass
to operate on pseudos directly, but also strengthens several other optimization
passes, such as \s-1CSE\s0, loop optimizer and trivial dead code remover.  It can,
however, make debugging impossible, since variables will no longer stay in a
\&\*(L"home register\*(R".
.Sp
Enabled by default with \fB\-funroll\-loops\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fwhole\-program\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fwhole-program"
Assume that the current compilation unit represents whole program being
compiled.  All public functions and variables with the exception of \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR
and those merged by attribute \f(CW\*(C`externally_visible\*(C'\fR become static functions
and in a affect gets more aggressively optimized by interprocedural optimizers.
While this option is equivalent to proper use of \f(CW\*(C`static\*(C'\fR keyword for
programs consisting of single file, in combination with option
\&\fB\-\-combine\fR this flag can be used to compile most of smaller scale C
programs since the functions and variables become local for the whole combined
compilation unit, not for the single source file itself.
.Sp
This option is not supported for Fortran programs.
.IP "\fB\-fcprop\-registers\fR" 4

After register allocation and post-register allocation instruction splitting,
we perform a copy-propagation pass to try to reduce scheduling dependencies

.IP "\fB\-fprofile\-generate\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fprofile-generate"
Enable options usually used for instrumenting application to produce
profile useful for later recompilation with profile feedback based

compiling and when linking your program.
.Sp
The following options are enabled: \f(CW\*(C`\-fprofile\-arcs\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-fprofile\-values\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-fvpt\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fprofile\-use\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fprofile-use"
Enable profile feedback directed optimizations, and optimizations
generally profitable only with profile feedback available.
.Sp
The following options are enabled: \f(CW\*(C`\-fbranch\-probabilities\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-fvpt\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-funroll\-loops\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-fpeel\-loops\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-ftracer\*(C'\fR
.Sp
By default, \s-1GCC\s0 emits an error message if the feedback profiles do not
match the source code.  This error can be turned into a warning by using
\&\fB\-Wcoverage\-mismatch\fR.  Note this may result in poorly optimized
code.
.PP
The following options control compiler behavior regarding floating
point arithmetic.  These options trade off between speed and
correctness.  All must be specifically enabled.
.IP "\fB\-ffloat\-store\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffloat-store"
Do not store floating point variables in registers, and inhibit other
options that might change whether a floating point value is taken from a
register or memory.
.Sp
This option prevents undesirable excess precision on machines such as
the 68000 where the floating registers (of the 68881) keep more
precision than a \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR is supposed to have.  Similarly for the
x86 architecture.  For most programs, the excess precision does only
good, but a few programs rely on the precise definition of \s-1IEEE\s0 floating
point.  Use \fB\-ffloat\-store\fR for such programs, after modifying
them to store all pertinent intermediate computations into variables.
.IP "\fB\-ffast\-math\fR" 4

.Sp
This option causes the preprocessor macro \f(CW\*(C`_\|_FAST_MATH_\|_\*(C'\fR to be defined.
.Sp
This option is not turned on by any \fB\-O\fR option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs which depend on
an exact implementation of \s-1IEEE\s0 or \s-1ISO\s0 rules/specifications for
math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for programs
that do not require the guarantees of these specifications.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-math\-errno\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-math-errno"
Do not set \s-1ERRNO\s0 after calling math functions that are executed
with a single instruction, e.g., sqrt.  A program that relies on
\&\s-1IEEE\s0 exceptions for math error handling may want to use this flag
for speed while maintaining \s-1IEEE\s0 arithmetic compatibility.
.Sp
This option is not turned on by any \fB\-O\fR option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs which depend on
an exact implementation of \s-1IEEE\s0 or \s-1ISO\s0 rules/specifications for
math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for programs
that do not require the guarantees of these specifications.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-fmath\-errno\fR.
.Sp
On Darwin systems, the math library never sets \f(CW\*(C`errno\*(C'\fR.  There is
therefore no reason for the compiler to consider the possibility that
it might, and \fB\-fno\-math\-errno\fR is the default.
.IP "\fB\-funsafe\-math\-optimizations\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funsafe-math-optimizations"
Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that (a) assume
that arguments and results are valid and (b) may violate \s-1IEEE\s0 or

similar optimizations.

Enables \fB\-fno\-signed\-zeros\fR, \fB\-fno\-trapping\-math\fR,
\&\fB\-fassociative\-math\fR and \fB\-freciprocal\-math\fR.

The default is \fB\-fno\-unsafe\-math\-optimizations\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fassociative\-math\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fassociative-math"
Allow re-association of operands in series of floating-point operations.
This violates the \s-1ISO\s0 C and \*(C+ language standard by possibly changing
computation result.  \s-1NOTE:\s0 re-ordering may change the sign of zero as
well as ignore NaNs and inhibit or create underflow or overflow (and
thus cannot be used on a code which relies on rounding behavior like
\&\f(CW\*(C`(x + 2**52) \- 2**52)\*(C'\fR.  May also reorder floating-point comparisons
and thus may not be used when ordered comparisons are required.
This option requires that both \fB\-fno\-signed\-zeros\fR and
\&\fB\-fno\-trapping\-math\fR be in effect.  Moreover, it doesn't make
much sense with \fB\-frounding\-math\fR.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-fno\-associative\-math\fR.
.IP "\fB\-freciprocal\-math\fR" 4
.IX Item "-freciprocal-math"
Allow the reciprocal of a value to be used instead of dividing by
the value if this enables optimizations.  For example \f(CW\*(C`x / y\*(C'\fR
can be replaced with \f(CW\*(C`x * (1/y)\*(C'\fR which is useful if \f(CW\*(C`(1/y)\*(C'\fR
is subject to common subexpression elimination.  Note that this loses
precision and increases the number of flops operating on the value.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-fno\-reciprocal\-math\fR.
.IP "\fB\-ffinite\-math\-only\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffinite-math-only"
Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that assume
that arguments and results are not NaNs or +\-Infs.
.Sp
This option is not turned on by any \fB\-O\fR option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs which depend on
an exact implementation of \s-1IEEE\s0 or \s-1ISO\s0 rules/specifications for
math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for programs
that do not require the guarantees of these specifications.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-fno\-finite\-math\-only\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-signed\-zeros\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-signed-zeros"
Allow optimizations for floating point arithmetic that ignore the
signedness of zero.  \s-1IEEE\s0 arithmetic specifies the behavior of
distinct +0.0 and \-0.0 values, which then prohibits simplification
of expressions such as x+0.0 or 0.0*x (even with \fB\-ffinite\-math\-only\fR).
This option implies that the sign of a zero result isn't significant.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-fsigned\-zeros\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-trapping\-math\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-trapping-math"
Compile code assuming that floating-point operations cannot generate
user-visible traps.  These traps include division by zero, overflow,
underflow, inexact result and invalid operation.  This option requires
that \fB\-fno\-signaling\-nans\fR be in effect.  Setting this option may
allow faster code if one relies on \*(L"non-stop\*(R" \s-1IEEE\s0 arithmetic, for example.
.Sp
This option should never be turned on by any \fB\-O\fR option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs which depend on
an exact implementation of \s-1IEEE\s0 or \s-1ISO\s0 rules/specifications for
math functions.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-ftrapping\-math\fR.
.IP "\fB\-frounding\-math\fR" 4
.IX Item "-frounding-math"
Disable transformations and optimizations that assume default floating
point rounding behavior.  This is round-to-zero for all floating point
to integer conversions, and round-to-nearest for all other arithmetic
truncations.  This option should be specified for programs that change
the \s-1FP\s0 rounding mode dynamically, or that may be executed with a
non-default rounding mode.  This option disables constant folding of
floating point expressions at compile-time (which may be affected by
rounding mode) and arithmetic transformations that are unsafe in the
presence of sign-dependent rounding modes.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-fno\-rounding\-math\fR.
.Sp
This option is experimental and does not currently guarantee to
disable all \s-1GCC\s0 optimizations that are affected by rounding mode.
Future versions of \s-1GCC\s0 may provide finer control of this setting
using C99's \f(CW\*(C`FENV_ACCESS\*(C'\fR pragma.  This command line option
will be used to specify the default state for \f(CW\*(C`FENV_ACCESS\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-frtl\-abstract\-sequences\fR" 4
.IX Item "-frtl-abstract-sequences"
It is a size optimization method. This option is to find identical
sequences of code, which can be turned into pseudo-procedures  and
then  replace  all  occurrences with  calls to  the  newly created

Attempt to avoid false dependencies in scheduled code by making use
of registers left over after register allocation.  This optimization
will most benefit processors with lots of registers.  Depending on the

.IX Item "-fdata-sections"
.PD
Place each function or data item into its own section in the output
file if the target supports arbitrary sections.  The name of the
function or the name of the data item determines the section's name
in the output file.
.Sp
Use these options on systems where the linker can perform optimizations
to improve locality of reference in the instruction space.  Most systems
using the \s-1ELF\s0 object format and \s-1SPARC\s0 processors running Solaris 2 have
linkers with such optimizations.  \s-1AIX\s0 may have these optimizations in
the future.
.Sp
Only use these options when there are significant benefits from doing
so.  When you specify these options, the assembler and linker will
create larger object and executable files and will also be slower.
You will not be able to use \f(CW\*(C`gprof\*(C'\fR on all systems if you
specify this option and you may have problems with debugging if
you specify both this option and \fB\-g\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fbranch\-target\-load\-optimize\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fbranch-target-load-optimize"
Perform branch target register load optimization before prologue / epilogue
threading.
The use of target registers can typically be exposed only during reload,
thus hoisting loads out of loops and doing inter-block scheduling needs
a separate optimization pass.
.IP "\fB\-fbranch\-target\-load\-optimize2\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fbranch-target-load-optimize2"
Perform branch target register load optimization after prologue / epilogue
threading.
.IP "\fB\-fbtr\-bb\-exclusive\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fbtr-bb-exclusive"
When performing branch target register load optimization, don't reuse
branch target registers in within any basic block.
.IP "\fB\-fstack\-protector\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstack-protector"
Emit extra code to check for buffer overflows, such as stack smashing
attacks.  This is done by adding a guard variable to functions with
vulnerable objects.  This includes functions that call alloca, and
functions with buffers larger than 8 bytes.  The guards are initialized
when a function is entered and then checked when the function exits.
If a guard check fails, an error message is printed and the program exits.
.IP "\fB\-fstack\-protector\-all\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstack-protector-all"
Like \fB\-fstack\-protector\fR except that all functions are protected.
.IP "\fB\-fsection\-anchors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsection-anchors"
Try to reduce the number of symbolic address calculations by using
shared \*(L"anchor\*(R" symbols to address nearby objects.  This transformation
can help to reduce the number of \s-1GOT\s0 entries and \s-1GOT\s0 accesses on some
targets.
.Sp
For example, the implementation of the following function \f(CW\*(C`foo\*(C'\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        static int a, b, c;
\&        int foo (void) { return a + b + c; }
.Ve
.Sp
would usually calculate the addresses of all three variables, but if you
compile it with \fB\-fsection\-anchors\fR, it will access the variables
from a common anchor point instead.  The effect is similar to the
following pseudocode (which isn't valid C):
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        int foo (void)
\&        {
\&          register int *xr = &x;
\&          return xr[&a \- &x] + xr[&b \- &x] + xr[&c \- &x];
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
Not all targets support this option.
.IP "\fB\-\-param\fR \fIname\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR" 4
.IX Item "--param name=value"
In some places, \s-1GCC\s0 uses various constants to control the amount of
optimization that is done.  For example, \s-1GCC\s0 will not inline functions
that contain more that a certain number of instructions.  You can
control some of these constants on the command-line using the
\&\fB\-\-param\fR option.
.Sp
The names of specific parameters, and the meaning of the values, are
tied to the internals of the compiler, and are subject to change
without notice in future releases.
.Sp
In each case, the \fIvalue\fR is an integer.  The allowable choices for
\&\fIname\fR are given in the following table:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBsalias-max-implicit-fields\fR" 4
.IX Item "salias-max-implicit-fields"
The maximum number of fields in a variable without direct
structure accesses for which structure aliasing will consider trying
to track each field.  The default is 5
.IP "\fBsalias-max-array-elements\fR" 4
.IX Item "salias-max-array-elements"
The maximum number of elements an array can have and its elements
still be tracked individually by structure aliasing. The default is 4
.IP "\fBsra-max-structure-size\fR" 4
.IX Item "sra-max-structure-size"
The maximum structure size, in bytes, at which the scalar replacement
of aggregates (\s-1SRA\s0) optimization will perform block copies.  The
default value, 0, implies that \s-1GCC\s0 will select the most appropriate
size itself.
.IP "\fBsra-field-structure-ratio\fR" 4
.IX Item "sra-field-structure-ratio"
The threshold ratio (as a percentage) between instantiated fields and
the complete structure size.  We say that if the ratio of the number
of bytes in instantiated fields to the number of bytes in the complete
structure exceeds this parameter, then block copies are not used.  The
default is 75.
.IP "\fBstruct-reorg-cold-struct-ratio\fR" 4
.IX Item "struct-reorg-cold-struct-ratio"
The threshold ratio (as a percentage) between a structure frequency
and the frequency of the hottest structure in the program.  This parameter
is used by struct-reorg optimization enabled by \fB\-fipa\-struct\-reorg\fR.
We say that if the ratio of a structure frequency, calculated by profiling, 
to the hottest structure frequency in the program is less than this 
parameter, then structure reorganization is not applied to this structure.
The default is 10.
.IP "\fBmax-crossjump-edges\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-crossjump-edges"
The maximum number of incoming edges to consider for crossjumping.
The algorithm used by \fB\-fcrossjumping\fR is O(N^2) in
the number of edges incoming to each block.  Increasing values mean
more aggressive optimization, making the compile time increase with
probably small improvement in executable size.
.IP "\fBmin-crossjump-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "min-crossjump-insns"
The minimum number of instructions which must be matched at the end
of two blocks before crossjumping will be performed on them.  This
value is ignored in the case where all instructions in the block being
crossjumped from are matched.  The default value is 5.
.IP "\fBmax-grow-copy-bb-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-grow-copy-bb-insns"
The maximum code size expansion factor when copying basic blocks
instead of jumping.  The expansion is relative to a jump instruction.
The default value is 8.
.IP "\fBmax-goto-duplication-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-goto-duplication-insns"
The maximum number of instructions to duplicate to a block that jumps
to a computed goto.  To avoid O(N^2) behavior in a number of
passes, \s-1GCC\s0 factors computed gotos early in the compilation process,
and unfactors them as late as possible.  Only computed jumps at the
end of a basic blocks with no more than max-goto-duplication-insns are
unfactored.  The default value is 8.
.IP "\fBmax-delay-slot-insn-search\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-delay-slot-insn-search"
The maximum number of instructions to consider when looking for an
instruction to fill a delay slot.  If more than this arbitrary number of
instructions is searched, the time savings from filling the delay slot
will be minimal so stop searching.  Increasing values mean more
aggressive optimization, making the compile time increase with probably
small improvement in executable run time.
.IP "\fBmax-delay-slot-live-search\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-delay-slot-live-search"
When trying to fill delay slots, the maximum number of instructions to
consider when searching for a block with valid live register
information.  Increasing this arbitrarily chosen value means more
aggressive optimization, increasing the compile time.  This parameter
should be removed when the delay slot code is rewritten to maintain the
control-flow graph.
.IP "\fBmax-gcse-memory\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-gcse-memory"
The approximate maximum amount of memory that will be allocated in
order to perform the global common subexpression elimination
optimization.  If more memory than specified is required, the
optimization will not be done.
.IP "\fBmax-gcse-passes\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-gcse-passes"
The maximum number of passes of \s-1GCSE\s0 to run.  The default is 1.
.IP "\fBmax-pending-list-length\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-pending-list-length"
The maximum number of pending dependencies scheduling will allow
before flushing the current state and starting over.  Large functions
with few branches or calls can create excessively large lists which
needlessly consume memory and resources.
.IP "\fBmax-inline-insns-single\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-inline-insns-single"
Several parameters control the tree inliner used in gcc.
This number sets the maximum number of instructions (counted in \s-1GCC\s0's
internal representation) in a single function that the tree inliner
will consider for inlining.  This only affects functions declared
inline and methods implemented in a class declaration (\*(C+).
The default value is 450.
.IP "\fBmax-inline-insns-auto\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-inline-insns-auto"
When you use \fB\-finline\-functions\fR (included in \fB\-O3\fR),
a lot of functions that would otherwise not be considered for inlining
by the compiler will be investigated.  To those functions, a different
(more restrictive) limit compared to functions declared inline can
be applied.
The default value is 90.
.IP "\fBlarge-function-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "large-function-insns"
The limit specifying really large functions.  For functions larger than this
limit after inlining inlining is constrained by
\&\fB\-\-param large-function-growth\fR.  This parameter is useful primarily
to avoid extreme compilation time caused by non-linear algorithms used by the
backend.
This parameter is ignored when \fB\-funit\-at\-a\-time\fR is not used.
The default value is 2700.
.IP "\fBlarge-function-growth\fR" 4
.IX Item "large-function-growth"
Specifies maximal growth of large function caused by inlining in percents.
This parameter is ignored when \fB\-funit\-at\-a\-time\fR is not used.
The default value is 100 which limits large function growth to 2.0 times
the original size.
.IP "\fBlarge-unit-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "large-unit-insns"
The limit specifying large translation unit.  Growth caused by inlining of
units larger than this limit is limited by \fB\-\-param inline-unit-growth\fR.
For small units this might be too tight (consider unit consisting of function A
that is inline and B that just calls A three time.  If B is small relative to
A, the growth of unit is 300\e% and yet such inlining is very sane.  For very
large units consisting of small inlineable functions however the overall unit
growth limit is needed to avoid exponential explosion of code size.  Thus for
smaller units, the size is increased to \fB\-\-param large-unit-insns\fR
before applying \fB\-\-param inline-unit-growth\fR.  The default is 10000
.IP "\fBinline-unit-growth\fR" 4
.IX Item "inline-unit-growth"
Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit caused by inlining.
This parameter is ignored when \fB\-funit\-at\-a\-time\fR is not used.
The default value is 30 which limits unit growth to 1.3 times the original
size.
.IP "\fBlarge-stack-frame\fR" 4
.IX Item "large-stack-frame"
The limit specifying large stack frames.  While inlining the algorithm is trying
to not grow past this limit too much.  Default value is 256 bytes.
.IP "\fBlarge-stack-frame-growth\fR" 4
.IX Item "large-stack-frame-growth"
Specifies maximal growth of large stack frames caused by inlining in percents.
The default value is 1000 which limits large stack frame growth to 11 times
the original size.
.IP "\fBmax-inline-insns-recursive\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-inline-insns-recursive"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBmax-inline-insns-recursive-auto\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-inline-insns-recursive-auto"
.PD
Specifies maximum number of instructions out-of-line copy of self recursive inline
function can grow into by performing recursive inlining.
.Sp
For functions declared inline \fB\-\-param max-inline-insns-recursive\fR is
taken into account.  For function not declared inline, recursive inlining
happens only when \fB\-finline\-functions\fR (included in \fB\-O3\fR) is
enabled and \fB\-\-param max-inline-insns-recursive-auto\fR is used.  The
default value is 450.
.IP "\fBmax-inline-recursive-depth\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-inline-recursive-depth"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBmax-inline-recursive-depth-auto\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-inline-recursive-depth-auto"
.PD
Specifies maximum recursion depth used by the recursive inlining.
.Sp
For functions declared inline \fB\-\-param max-inline-recursive-depth\fR is
taken into account.  For function not declared inline, recursive inlining
happens only when \fB\-finline\-functions\fR (included in \fB\-O3\fR) is
enabled and \fB\-\-param max-inline-recursive-depth-auto\fR is used.  The
default value is 8.
.IP "\fBmin-inline-recursive-probability\fR" 4
.IX Item "min-inline-recursive-probability"
Recursive inlining is profitable only for function having deep recursion
in average and can hurt for function having little recursion depth by
increasing the prologue size or complexity of function body to other
optimizers.
.Sp
When profile feedback is available (see \fB\-fprofile\-generate\fR) the actual
recursion depth can be guessed from probability that function will recurse via
given call expression.  This parameter limits inlining only to call expression
whose probability exceeds given threshold (in percents).  The default value is
10.
.IP "\fBinline-call-cost\fR" 4
.IX Item "inline-call-cost"
Specify cost of call instruction relative to simple arithmetics operations
(having cost of 1).  Increasing this cost disqualifies inlining of non-leaf
functions and at the same time increases size of leaf function that is believed to
reduce function size by being inlined.  In effect it increases amount of
inlining for code having large abstraction penalty (many functions that just
pass the arguments to other functions) and decrease inlining for code with low
abstraction penalty.  The default value is 12.
.IP "\fBmin-vect-loop-bound\fR" 4
.IX Item "min-vect-loop-bound"
The minimum number of iterations under which a loop will not get vectorized
when \fB\-ftree\-vectorize\fR is used.  The number of iterations after
vectorization needs to be greater than the value specified by this option
to allow vectorization.  The default value is 0.
.IP "\fBmax-unrolled-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-unrolled-insns"
The maximum number of instructions that a loop should have if that loop
is unrolled, and if the loop is unrolled, it determines how many times
the loop code is unrolled.
.IP "\fBmax-average-unrolled-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-average-unrolled-insns"
The maximum number of instructions biased by probabilities of their execution
that a loop should have if that loop is unrolled, and if the loop is unrolled,
it determines how many times the loop code is unrolled.
.IP "\fBmax-unroll-times\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-unroll-times"
The maximum number of unrollings of a single loop.
.IP "\fBmax-peeled-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-peeled-insns"
The maximum number of instructions that a loop should have if that loop
is peeled, and if the loop is peeled, it determines how many times
the loop code is peeled.
.IP "\fBmax-peel-times\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-peel-times"
The maximum number of peelings of a single loop.
.IP "\fBmax-completely-peeled-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-completely-peeled-insns"
The maximum number of insns of a completely peeled loop.
.IP "\fBmax-completely-peel-times\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-completely-peel-times"
The maximum number of iterations of a loop to be suitable for complete peeling.
.IP "\fBmax-unswitch-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-unswitch-insns"
The maximum number of insns of an unswitched loop.
.IP "\fBmax-unswitch-level\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-unswitch-level"
The maximum number of branches unswitched in a single loop.
.IP "\fBlim-expensive\fR" 4
.IX Item "lim-expensive"
The minimum cost of an expensive expression in the loop invariant motion.
.IP "\fBiv-consider-all-candidates-bound\fR" 4
.IX Item "iv-consider-all-candidates-bound"
Bound on number of candidates for induction variables below that
all candidates are considered for each use in induction variable
optimizations.  Only the most relevant candidates are considered
if there are more candidates, to avoid quadratic time complexity.
.IP "\fBiv-max-considered-uses\fR" 4
.IX Item "iv-max-considered-uses"
The induction variable optimizations give up on loops that contain more
induction variable uses.
.IP "\fBiv-always-prune-cand-set-bound\fR" 4
.IX Item "iv-always-prune-cand-set-bound"
If number of candidates in the set is smaller than this value,
we always try to remove unnecessary ivs from the set during its
optimization when a new iv is added to the set.
.IP "\fBscev-max-expr-size\fR" 4
.IX Item "scev-max-expr-size"
Bound on size of expressions used in the scalar evolutions analyzer.
Large expressions slow the analyzer.
.IP "\fBomega-max-vars\fR" 4
