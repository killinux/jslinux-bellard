er, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.
.Sp
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.
.IP "9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies." 4
.IX Item "9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies."
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run
a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
.IP "10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients." 4
.IX Item "10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients."
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
.Sp
An \*(L"entity transaction\*(R" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
.Sp
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
.IP "11. Patents." 4
.IX Item "11. Patents."
A \*(L"contributor\*(R" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's \*(L"contributor version\*(R".
.Sp
A contributor's \*(L"essential patent claims\*(R" are all patent claims owned
or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, \*(L"control\*(R" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.
.Sp
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.
.Sp
In the following three paragraphs, a \*(L"patent license\*(R" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To \*(L"grant\*(R" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.
.Sp
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  \*(L"Knowingly relying\*(R" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.
.Sp
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.
.Sp
A patent license is \*(L"discriminatory\*(R" if it does not include within the
scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on
the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically
granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you
are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the
business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the
third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the
work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties
who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent
license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by
you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in
connection with specific products or compilations that contain the
covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent
license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
.Sp
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
.IP "12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom." 4
.IX Item "12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom."
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey
a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree
to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying
from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could
satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely
from conveying the Program.
.IP "13. Use with the \s-1GNU\s0 Affero General Public License." 4
.IX Item "13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License."
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the \s-1GNU\s0 Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the \s-1GNU\s0 Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.
.IP "14. Revised Versions of this License." 4
.IX Item "14. Revised Versions of this License."
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the \s-1GNU\s0 General Public License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
.Sp
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies that a certain numbered version of the \s-1GNU\s0 General Public
License \*(L"or any later version\*(R" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or
of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If
the Program does not specify a version number of the \s-1GNU\s0 General
Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
Software Foundation.
.Sp
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions
of the \s-1GNU\s0 General Public License can be used, that proxy's public
statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to
choose that version for the Program.
.Sp
Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

.IX Subsection "How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs"
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.
.PP
To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the \*(L"copyright\*(R" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
.PP

.PP
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
.PP
If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        <program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> 
\&        This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type "show w".

.Ve
.PP
The hypothetical commands \fBshow w\fR and \fBshow c\fR should show
the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your
program's commands might be different; for a \s-1GUI\s0 interface, you would
use an \*(L"about box\*(R".
.PP
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a \*(L"copyright disclaimer\*(R" for the program, if necessary.

<\fBhttp://www.gnu.org/licenses/\fR>.
.PP
The \s-1GNU\s0 General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use
the \s-1GNU\s0 Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But
first, please read <\fBhttp://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why\-not\-lgpl.html\fR>.
