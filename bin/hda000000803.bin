turns 0 if there is no remainder, and 1 if
	there is a remainder.  For examples, quomod(10, 3, x, y) sets x to 3,
	y to 1, and returns the value 1, and quomod(-4, 3.14159, x, y) sets x
	to -2, y to 2.28318, and returns the value 1.

	The eval function accepts a string argument and evaluates the
	expression represented by the string and returns its value.
	The expression can include function calls and variable references.
	For example, eval("fact(3) + 7") returns 13.  When combined with
	the prompt function, this allows the calculator to read values from
	the user.  For example, x=eval(prompt("Number: ")) sets x to the
	value input by the user.

	The digit and bit functions return individual digits of a number,
	either in base 10 or in base 2, where the lowest digit of a number
	is at digit position 0.	 For example, digit(5678, 3) is 5, and
	bit(0b1000100, 2) is 1.	 Negative digit positions indicate places
	to the right of the decimal or binary point, so that for example,
	digit(3.456, -1) is 4.

	The ptest builtin is a primality testing function.  The
	1st argument is the suspected prime to be tested.  The
	absolute value of the 2nd argument is an iteration count.

	If ptest is called with only 2 args, the 3rd argument is
	assumed to be 0.  If ptest is called with only 1 arg, the
	2nd argument is assumed to be 1.  Thus, the following
	calls are equivalent:

		ptest(a)
		ptest(a,1)
		ptest(a,1,0)

	Normally ptest performs a some checks to determine if the
	value is divisable by some trivial prime.  If the 2nd
	argument is < 0, then the trivial check is omitted.

	For example, ptest(a,10) performs the same work as:

		ptest(a,-3)	(7 tests without trivial check)
		ptest(a,-7,3)	(3 more tests without the trivial check)

	The ptest function returns 0 if the number is definitely not
	prime, and 1 is the number is probably prime.  The chance
	of a number which is probably prime being actually composite
	is less than 1/4 raised to the power of the iteration count.
	For example, for a random number p, ptest(p, 10) incorrectly
	returns 1 less than once in every million numbers, and you
	will probably never find a number where ptest(p, 20) gives
	the wrong answer.

	The first 3 args of nextcand and prevcand functions are the same
	arguments as ptest.  But unlike ptest, nextcand and prevcand return
	the next and previous values for which ptest is true.

	For example, nextcand(2^1000) returns 2^1000+297 because
	2^1000+297 is the smallest value x > 2^1000 for which
	ptest(x,1) is true.  And for example, prevcand(2^31-1,10,5)
	returns 2147483629 (2^31-19) because 2^31-19 is the largest
	value y < 2^31-1 for which ptest(y,10,5) is true.

	The nextcand and prevcand functions also have a 5 argument form:

		nextcand(num, count, skip, modval, modulus)
		prevcand(num, count, skip, modval, modulus)

	return the smallest (or largest) value ans > num (or < num) that
	is also == modval % modulus for which ptest(ans,count,skip) is true.

	The builtins nextprime(x) and prevprime(x) return the
	next and previous primes with respect to x respectively.
	As of this release, x must be < 2^32.  With one argument, they
	will return an error if x is out of range.  With two arguments,
	they will not generate an error but instead will return y.

	The builtin function pix(x) returns the number of primes <= x.
	As of this release, x must be < 2^32.  With one argument, pix(x)
	will return an error if x is out of range.  With two arguments,
	pix(x,y) will not generate an error but instead will return y.

	The builtin function factor may be used to search for the
	smallest factor of a given number.  The call factor(x,y)
	will attempt to find the smallest factor of x < min(x,y).
	As of this release, y must be < 2^32.  If y is omitted, y
	is assumed to be 2^32-1.

	If x < 0, factor(x,y) will return -1.  If no factor <
	min(x,y) is found, factor(x,y) will return 1.  In all other
	cases, factor(x,y) will return the smallest prime factor
	of x.  Note except for the case when abs(x) == 1, factor(x,y)
	will not return x.

	If factor is called with y that is too large, or if x or y
	is not an integer, calc will report an error.  If a 3rd argument
	is given, factor will return that value instead.  For example,
	factor(1/2,b,c) will return c instead of issuing an error.

	The builtin lfactor(x,y) searches a number of primes instead
	of below a limit.  As of this release, y must be <= 203280221
	(y <= pix(2^32-1)).  In all other cases, lfactor is operates
	in the same way as factor.

	If lfactor is called with y that is too large, or if x or y
	is not an integer, calc will report an error.  If a 3rd argument
	is given, lfactor will return that value instead.  For example,
	lfactor(1/2,b,c) will return c instead of issuing an error.

	The lfactor function is slower than factor.  If possible factor
	should be used instead of lfactor.

	The builtin isprime(x) will attempt to determine if x is prime.
	As of this release, x must be < 2^32.  With one argument, isprime(x)
	will return an error if x is out of range.  With two arguments,
	isprime(x,y) will not generate an error but instead will return y.

	The functions rcin, rcmul, rcout, rcpow, and rcsq are used to
	perform modular arithmetic calculations for large odd numbers
	faster than the usual methods.	To do this, you first use the
	rcin function to convert all input values into numbers which are
	in a format called REDC format.	 Then you use rcmul, rcsq, and
	rcpow to multiply such numbers together to produce results also
	in REDC format.	 Finally, you use rcout to convert a number in
	REDC format back to a normal number.  The addition, subtraction,
	negation, and equality comparison between REDC numbers are done
	using the normal modular methods.  For example, to calculate the
	value 13 * 17 + 1 (mod 11), you could use:

		p = 11;
		t1 = rcin(13, p);
		t2 = rcin(17, p);
		t3 = rcin(1, p);
		t4 = rcmul(t1, t2, p);
		t5 = (t4 + t3) % p;
		answer = rcout(t5, p);

	The swap function exchanges the values of two variables without
	performing copies.  For example, after:

		x = 17;
		y = 19;
		swap(x, y);

	then x is 19 and y is 17.  This function should not be used to
	swap a value which is contained within another one.  If this is
	done, then some memory will be lost.  For example, the following
	should not be done:

		mat x[5];
		swap(x, x[0]);

	The hash function returns a relatively small non-negative integer
	for one or more input values.  The hash values should not be used
	across runs of the calculator, since the algorithms used to generate
	the hash value may change with different versions of the calculator.

	The base function allows one to specify how numbers should be
	printed.  The base function provides a numeric shorthand to the
	config("mode") interface.  With no args, base() will return the
	current mode.  With 1 arg, base(val) will set the mode according to
	the arg and return the previous mode.

	The following convention is used to declare modes:

		 base	 config
		value	 string

		   2	"binary"	binary fractions
		   8	"octal"		octal fractions
		  10	"real"		decimal floating point
		  16	"hex"		hexadecimal fractions
		 -10	"int"		decimal integer
		 1/3	"frac"		decimal fractions
		1e20	"exp"		decimal exponential

	For convenience, any non-integer value is assumed to mean "frac",
	and any integer >= 2^64 is assumed to mean "exp".

    display - set and/or return decimal digits for displaying numbers

SYNOPSIS
    display([d])

TYPES
    d		integer >= 0

    return	integer

DESCRIPTION
    When given an argument, this function sets the maximum number of
    digits after the decimal point to be printed in real or exponential
    mode in normal unformatted printing (print, strprint, fprint) or in
    formatted printing (printf, strprintf, fprintf) when precision is
    not specified.  The return value is the previous display digit value.

    When given no arguments, this function returns the current
    display digit value.

    The builtin function:

    	display(d)
	display()

    is an alias for:

	config("display", d)
	config("display")

    The display digit value does not change the stored value of a number.
    It only changes how a stored value is displayed.

    Where rounding is necessary to display up to d decimal places,
    the type of rounding to be used is controlled by config("outround").

EXAMPLE
    ; print display(), 2/3
    20 ~0.66666666666666666667

    ; print display(40), 2/3
    20 ~0.6666666666666666666666666666666666666667

    ; print display(5), 2/3
    40 ~0.66667

    forall - to evaluate a function for all values of a list or matrix

SYNOPSIS
    forall(x, y)

TYPES
    x		list or matrix
    y		string

    return	null value

DESCRIPTION
    In forall(x,y), y is the name of a function; that function
    is performed in succession for all elements of x.  This is similar
    to modify(x, y) but x is not changed.

EXAMPLE
    ; global n = 0
    ; define s(a) {n += a;}
    ; A = list(1,2,3,4)
    ; forall(A, "s")
    ; n
	    10

    ; define e(a) {if (iseven(a)) print a;}

    custom - custom builtin interface

SYNOPSIS
    custom([custname [, arg ...]])

TYPES
    custname	string
    arg		any

    return	any

DESCRIPTION
    This function will invoke the custom function interface.  Custom
    functions are accessed by the custname argument.  The remainder
    of the args, if any, are passed to the custom function.  The
    custom function may return any value, including null.  Calling
    custom with no args is equivalent to the command 'show custom'.

    In order to use the custom interface, two things must happen:

	1) Calc must be built to allow custom functions.  By default,
	   the master Makefile is shipped with ALLOW_CUSTOM= -DCUSTOM
	   which causes custom functions to be compiled in.

	2) Calc must be invoked with an argument of -C as in:

		calc -C

    In other words, explicit action must be taken in order to
    enable the use of custom functions.	 By default (no -C arg)
    custom functions are compiled in but disabled so that only
    portable calc scripts may be used.

    The main focus for calc is to provide a portable platform for
    multi-precision calculations in a C-like environment.  You should
    consider implementing algorithms in the calc language as a first
    choice.  Sometimes an algorithm requires use of special hardware, a
    non-portable OS or pre-compiled C library.	In these cases a custom
    interface may be needed.

    The custom function interface is intended to make is easy for
    programmers to add functionality that would be otherwise
    un-suitable for general distribution.  Functions that are
    non-portable (machine, hardware or OS dependent) or highly
    specialized are possible candidates for custom functions.

    To add a new custom function requires access to calc source.
    For information on how to add a new custom function, try:

	    help new_custom

    To serve as examples, calc is shipped with a few custom functions.
    If calc if invoked with -C, then either of the following will
    display information about the custom functions that are available:

	    show custom
    or:

	    custom()

    A few resource files that uses these function are also provided
    to serve as usage examples.

    We welcome submissions for new custom functions.  For information
    on how to submit new custom functions for general distribution, see:

	    help contrib

EXAMPLE
    If calc compiled with ALLOW_CUSTOM= (custom disabled):

    ; print custom("sysinfo", "baseb")
	    Calc was built with custom functions disabled
    Error 10195

    If calc compiled with ALLOW_CUSTOM= -DCUSTOM and is invoked without -C:

    ; print custom("sysinfo", "baseb")
	    Calc must be run with a -C argument to use custom function
    Error 10194

    If calc compiled with ALLOW_CUSTOM= -DCUSTOM and is invoked with -C:

    ; print custom("sysinfo", "baseb")
    32

LIMITS
    By default, custom is limited to 100 args.

    none

    round - round numbers to a specified number of decimal places

SYNOPSIS
    round(x [,plcs [, rnd]])

TYPES
    If x is a matrix or a list, round(x[[i]], ...) is to return
    a value for each element x[[i]] of x; the value returned will be
    a matrix or list with the same structure as x.

    Otherwise, if x is an object of type tt, or if x is not an object or
    number but y is an object of type tt, and the function tt_round has
    to be defined; the types for x, plcs, rnd, and the returned value, if
    any, are as required or specified in the definition of tt_round.
    In this object case, plcs and rnd default to the null value.

    For other cases:

    x		number (real or complex)
    plcs	integer, defaults to zero
    rnd		integer, defaults to config("round")

    return	number

DESCRIPTION
    For real x, round(x, plcs, rnd) returns x rounded to either
    plcs significant figures (if rnd & 32 is nonzero) or to plcs
    decimal places (if rnd & 32 is zero).  In the significant-figure
    case the rounding is to plcs - ilog10(x) - 1 decimal places.
    If the number of decimal places is n and eps = 10^-n, the
    result is the same as for appr(x, eps, rnd).  This will be
    exactly x if x is a multiple of eps; otherwise rounding occurs
    to one of the nearest multiples of eps on either side of x.	 Which
    of these multiples is returned is determined by z = rnd & 31, i.e.
    the five low order bits of rnd, as follows:

	    z = 0 or 4:		round down, i.e. towards minus infinity
	    z = 1 or 5:		round up, i.e. towards plus infinity
	    z = 2 or 6:		round towards zero
	    z = 3 or 7:		round away from zero
	    z = 8 or 12:	round to the nearest even multiple of eps
	    z = 9 or 13:	round to the nearest odd multiple of eps
	    z = 10 or 14:	round to nearest even or odd multiple of eps
				    according as x > or < 0
	    z = 11 or 15:	round to nearest odd or even multiple of eps
				    according as x > or < 0
	    z = 16 to 31:	round to the nearest multiple of eps when
				    this is uniquely determined.  Otherwise
				    rounding is as if z is replaced by z - 16

    For complex x:

	The real and imaginary parts are rounded as for real x; if the
	imaginary part rounds to zero, the result is real.

    For matrix or list x:

	The returned values has element round(x[[i]], plcs, rnd) in
	the same position as x[[i]] in x.

    For object x or plcs:

	When round(x, plcs, rnd) is called, x is passed by address so may be
	changed by assignments; plcs and rnd are copied to temporary
	variables, so their values are not changed by the call.

EXAMPLES
    ; a = 7/32, b = -7/32

--------------------------

The following custom calc resource files are provided because they serve
as examples of how use the custom interface.  The custom interface
allows for machine dependent and/or non-portable code to be added as
builtins to the calc program.  A few example custom functions and
resource files are shipped with calc to provide you with examples.

By default, the custom builtin returns an error.  Calc have been
built with:

	ALLOW_CUSTOM= -DCUSTOM

in the top level Makefile (this is the shipped default) and calc
must be invoked with a -C argument:

	calc -C

when it is run.

See the ../cal/README or "help resource" for information about
calc resource standards and guidelines.

=-=

argv.cal

    argv(var, ...)

    print information about various args

halflen.cal

    halflen(num)

    Calculate the length of a numeric value in HALF's.

pzasusb8.cal

    Run custom("pzasusb8") on a standard set of data, print Endian
    related information and print value size information.

    fclose - close a file

SYNOPSIS
    fclose(fd)

TYPES
    fd		file

    return	nul or int

DESCRIPTION
    This function closes the open file associated with the descriptor fd.
    When this is done, the file value associated with the file remains
    a file value, but appears 'closed', and cannot be used in further
    file-related calls (except fclose) without causing errors.	This same
    action occurs to all copies of the file value.  You do not need to
    explicitly close all the copies of a file value.

    Standard input, standard output and standard error are always opened
    and cannot be closed.

    The truth value of a closed file is FALSE.

    The fclose function returns the numeric value of errno if
    there had been an error using the file, or the null value if
    there was no error.

    Closing a closed file is permitted.	 Fclose returns null in
    this case.

EXAMPLE
    ; fd = fopen("/etc/motd", "r")
    ; if (fd) print "file is open";
    file is open

    ; err = fclose(fd);
    ; if (isnull(err)) print "close successful"; else strerror(err);
    close successful

    ; if (!fd) print "file is closed";
    file is closed

LIMITS
    fd != files(0) && fd != files(1) && fd != files(2)

    none

SYNOPSIS
    meq(x, y, md)

TYPES
    x		real

DESCRIPTION
    Returns 1 if and only if for some integer n, x - y = n * md, i.e.
    x is congruent to y modulo md.

    If md = 0, this is equivalent to x == y.

    For any x, y, md, meq(x, y, md) = ismult(x - y, md).

    head - create a list of specified size from the head of a list

SYNOPSIS
    head(x, y)

TYPES
    x		list
    y		int

    return	list

DESCRIPTION
    If 0 <= y <= size(x), head(x,y) returns a list of size y whose
    elements in succession have values x[[0]]. x[[1]], ..., x[[y - 1]].

    If y > size(x), head(x,y) is a copy of x.

    If -size(x) < y < 0, head(x,y) returns a list of size (size(x) + y)
    whose elements in succession have values x[[0]]. x[[1]], ...,
    i.e. a copy of x from which the last -y members have been deleted.

    If y <= -size(x), head(x,y) returns a list with no members.

    For any integer y, x == join(head(x,y), tail(x,-y)).

EXAMPLE
    ; A = list(2, 3, 5, 7, 11)
    ; head(A, 2)

    list (2 members, 2 nonzero):
	  [[0]] = 2
	  [[1]] = 3

    ; head(A, -2)

    list (3 members, 3 nonzero):
	  [[0]] = 2
	  [[1]] = 3
	  [[2]] = 5
