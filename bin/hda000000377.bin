\&\fBmips1\fR for 32\-bit ABIs and \fBmips3\fR for 64\-bit ABIs).
.Sp
In processor names, a final \fB000\fR can be abbreviated as \fBk\fR
(for example, \fB\-march=r2k\fR).  Prefixes are optional, and
\&\fBvr\fR may be written \fBr\fR.
.Sp
Names of the form \fIn\fR\fBf2_1\fR refer to processors with
FPUs clocked at half the rate of the core, names of the form
\&\fIn\fR\fBf1_1\fR refer to processors with FPUs clocked at the same
rate as the core, and names of the form \fIn\fR\fBf3_2\fR refer to
processors with FPUs clocked a ratio of 3:2 with respect to the core.
For compatibility reasons, \fIn\fR\fBf\fR is accepted as a synonym
for \fIn\fR\fBf2_1\fR while \fIn\fR\fBx\fR and \fIb\fR\fBfx\fR are
accepted as synonyms for \fIn\fR\fBf1_1\fR.
.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 defines two macros based on the value of this option.  The first
is \fB_MIPS_ARCH\fR, which gives the name of target architecture, as
a string.  The second has the form \fB_MIPS_ARCH_\fR\fIfoo\fR,
where \fIfoo\fR is the capitalized value of \fB_MIPS_ARCH\fR.
For example, \fB\-march=r2000\fR will set \fB_MIPS_ARCH\fR
to \fB\*(L"r2000\*(R"\fR and define the macro \fB_MIPS_ARCH_R2000\fR.
.Sp
Note that the \fB_MIPS_ARCH\fR macro uses the processor names given
above.  In other words, it will have the full prefix and will not
abbreviate \fB000\fR as \fBk\fR.  In the case of \fBfrom-abi\fR,
the macro names the resolved architecture (either \fB\*(L"mips1\*(R"\fR or
\&\fB\*(L"mips3\*(R"\fR).  It names the default architecture when no
\&\fB\-march\fR option is given.
.IP "\fB\-mtune=\fR\fIarch\fR" 4

the way instructions are scheduled, and the perceived cost of arithmetic

.Sp
When this option is not used, \s-1GCC\s0 will optimize for the processor
specified by \fB\-march\fR.  By using \fB\-march\fR and
\&\fB\-mtune\fR together, it is possible to generate code that will
run on a family of processors, but optimize the code for one
particular member of that family.

\&\s-1GCC\s0 supports a variant of the o32 \s-1ABI\s0 in which floating-point registers

.Sp
The register assignments for arguments and return values remain the
same, but each scalar value is passed in a single 64\-bit register

floating-point values are returned in \fB\f(CB$f0\fB\fR only, not a

All \fB\-mabicalls\fR code has traditionally been position-independent,
regardless of options like \fB\-fPIC\fR and \fB\-fpic\fR.  However,

\&\s-1GCC\s0 normally uses a single instruction to load values from the \s-1GOT\s0.
While this is relatively efficient, it will only work if the \s-1GOT\s0

.Sp
If this happens, you should recompile your code with \fB\-mxgot\fR.
It should then work with very large GOTs, although it will also be
less efficient, since it will take three instructions to fetch the
value of a global symbol.

Note that some linkers can create multiple GOTs.  If you have such a
linker, you should only need to use \fB\-mxgot\fR when a single object
file accesses more than 64k's worth of \s-1GOT\s0 entries.  Very few do.

If the linker complains that an application is using too much small data,
you might want to try rebuilding the less performance-critical parts with
\&\fB\-mno\-local\-sdata\fR.  You might also want to build large

more room for the main program.

If you compile a module \fIMod\fR with \fB\-mextern\-sdata\fR \fB\-G\fR
\&\fInum\fR \fB\-mgpopt\fR, and \fIMod\fR references a variable \fIVar\fR
that is no bigger than \fInum\fR bytes, you must make sure that \fIVar\fR
is placed in a small data section.  If \fIVar\fR is defined by another
module, you must either compile that module with a high-enough
\&\fB\-G\fR setting or attach a \f(CW\*(C`section\*(C'\fR attribute to \fIVar\fR's
definition.  If \fIVar\fR is common, you must link the application
with a high-enough \fB\-G\fR setting.
.Sp
The easiest way of satisfying these restrictions is to compile
and link every module with the same \fB\-G\fR option.  However,
you may wish to build a library that supports several different
small data limits.  You can do this by compiling the library with
the highest supported \fB\-G\fR setting and additionally using
\&\fB\-mno\-extern\-sdata\fR to stop the library from making assumptions
about externally-defined data.

\&\s-1GCC\s0 supports two related instruction set architectures for the
\&\s-1RS/6000\s0 and PowerPC.  The \fI\s-1POWER\s0\fR instruction set are those
instructions supported by the \fBrios\fR chip set used in the original
\&\s-1RS/6000\s0 systems and the \fIPowerPC\fR instruction set is the
architecture of the Freescale MPC5xx, MPC6xx, MPC8xx microprocessors, and
the \s-1IBM\s0 4xx, 6xx, and follow-on microprocessors.
.Sp
Neither architecture is a subset of the other.  However there is a
large common subset of instructions supported by both.  An \s-1MQ\s0
register is included in processors supporting the \s-1POWER\s0 architecture.
.Sp
You use these options to specify which instructions are available on the
processor you are using.  The default value of these options is
determined when configuring \s-1GCC\s0.  Specifying the
\&\fB\-mcpu=\fR\fIcpu_type\fR overrides the specification of these
options.  We recommend you use the \fB\-mcpu=\fR\fIcpu_type\fR option
rather than the options listed above.
.Sp
The \fB\-mpower\fR option allows \s-1GCC\s0 to generate instructions that
are found only in the \s-1POWER\s0 architecture and to use the \s-1MQ\s0 register.
Specifying \fB\-mpower2\fR implies \fB\-power\fR and also allows \s-1GCC\s0
to generate instructions that are present in the \s-1POWER2\s0 architecture but
not the original \s-1POWER\s0 architecture.
.Sp
The \fB\-mpowerpc\fR option allows \s-1GCC\s0 to generate instructions that
are found only in the 32\-bit subset of the PowerPC architecture.
Specifying \fB\-mpowerpc\-gpopt\fR implies \fB\-mpowerpc\fR and also allows
\&\s-1GCC\s0 to use the optional PowerPC architecture instructions in the
General Purpose group, including floating-point square root.  Specifying
\&\fB\-mpowerpc\-gfxopt\fR implies \fB\-mpowerpc\fR and also allows \s-1GCC\s0 to
use the optional PowerPC architecture instructions in the Graphics
group, including floating-point select.
.Sp
The \fB\-mmfcrf\fR option allows \s-1GCC\s0 to generate the move from
condition register field instruction implemented on the \s-1POWER4\s0
processor and other processors that support the PowerPC V2.01
architecture.
The \fB\-mpopcntb\fR option allows \s-1GCC\s0 to generate the popcount and
double precision \s-1FP\s0 reciprocal estimate instruction implemented on the
\&\s-1POWER5\s0 processor and other processors that support the PowerPC V2.02
architecture.
The \fB\-mfprnd\fR option allows \s-1GCC\s0 to generate the \s-1FP\s0 round to
integer instructions implemented on the \s-1POWER5+\s0 processor and other
processors that support the PowerPC V2.03 architecture.
The \fB\-mcmpb\fR option allows \s-1GCC\s0 to generate the compare bytes
instruction implemented on the \s-1POWER6\s0 processor and other processors
that support the PowerPC V2.05 architecture.
The \fB\-mmfpgpr\fR option allows \s-1GCC\s0 to generate the \s-1FP\s0 move to/from
general purpose register instructions implemented on the \s-1POWER6X\s0
processor and other processors that support the extended PowerPC V2.05
architecture.
The \fB\-mhard\-dfp\fR option allows \s-1GCC\s0 to generate the decimal floating
point instructions implemented on some \s-1POWER\s0 processors.
.Sp
The \fB\-mpowerpc64\fR option allows \s-1GCC\s0 to generate the additional
64\-bit instructions that are found in the full PowerPC64 architecture
and to treat GPRs as 64\-bit, doubleword quantities.  \s-1GCC\s0 defaults to
\&\fB\-mno\-powerpc64\fR.
.Sp
If you specify both \fB\-mno\-power\fR and \fB\-mno\-powerpc\fR, \s-1GCC\s0
will use only the instructions in the common subset of both
architectures plus some special \s-1AIX\s0 common-mode calls, and will not use
the \s-1MQ\s0 register.  Specifying both \fB\-mpower\fR and \fB\-mpowerpc\fR
permits \s-1GCC\s0 to use any instruction from either architecture and to
allow use of the \s-1MQ\s0 register; specify this for the Motorola \s-1MPC601\s0.

.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mold\-mnemonics\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mold-mnemonics"
.PD
Select which mnemonics to use in the generated assembler code.  With
\&\fB\-mnew\-mnemonics\fR, \s-1GCC\s0 uses the assembler mnemonics defined for
the PowerPC architecture.  With \fB\-mold\-mnemonics\fR it uses the
assembler mnemonics defined for the \s-1POWER\s0 architecture.  Instructions
defined in only one architecture have only one mnemonic; \s-1GCC\s0 uses that
mnemonic irrespective of which of these options is specified.
.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 defaults to the mnemonics appropriate for the architecture in
use.  Specifying \fB\-mcpu=\fR\fIcpu_type\fR sometimes overrides the
value of these option.  Unless you are building a cross-compiler, you
should normally not specify either \fB\-mnew\-mnemonics\fR or
\&\fB\-mold\-mnemonics\fR, but should instead accept the default.
.IP "\fB\-mcpu=\fR\fIcpu_type\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mcpu=cpu_type"
Set architecture type, register usage, choice of mnemonics, and
instruction scheduling parameters for machine type \fIcpu_type\fR.

\&\fBrios\fR, \fBrios1\fR, \fBrios2\fR, \fBrsc\fR, and \fBrs64\fR.
.Sp
\&\fB\-mcpu=common\fR selects a completely generic processor.  Code
generated under this option will run on any \s-1POWER\s0 or PowerPC processor.
\&\s-1GCC\s0 will use only the instructions in the common subset of both
architectures, and will not use the \s-1MQ\s0 register.  \s-1GCC\s0 assumes a generic
processor model for scheduling purposes.
.Sp
\&\fB\-mcpu=power\fR, \fB\-mcpu=power2\fR, \fB\-mcpu=powerpc\fR, and
\&\fB\-mcpu=powerpc64\fR specify generic \s-1POWER\s0, \s-1POWER2\s0, pure 32\-bit
PowerPC (i.e., not \s-1MPC601\s0), and 64\-bit PowerPC architecture machine
types, with an appropriate, generic processor model assumed for
scheduling purposes.
.Sp
The other options specify a specific processor.  Code generated under
those options will run best on that processor, and may not run at all on
others.
.Sp
The \fB\-mcpu\fR options automatically enable or disable the
following options:
.Sp
\&\fB\-maltivec  \-mfprnd  \-mhard\-float  \-mmfcrf  \-mmultiple 
\&\-mnew\-mnemonics  \-mpopcntb  \-mpower  \-mpower2  \-mpowerpc64 
\&\-mpowerpc\-gpopt  \-mpowerpc\-gfxopt  \-mstring  \-mmulhw  \-mdlmzb  \-mmfpgpr\fR
.Sp
The particular options set for any particular \s-1CPU\s0 will vary between
compiler versions, depending on what setting seems to produce optimal
code for that \s-1CPU\s0; it doesn't necessarily reflect the actual hardware's
capabilities.  If you wish to set an individual option to a particular
value, you may specify it after the \fB\-mcpu\fR option, like
\&\fB\-mcpu=970 \-mno\-altivec\fR.
.Sp
On \s-1AIX\s0, the \fB\-maltivec\fR and \fB\-mpowerpc64\fR options are
not enabled or disabled by the \fB\-mcpu\fR option at present because
\&\s-1AIX\s0 does not have full support for these options.  You may still
enable or disable them individually if you're sure it'll work in your
environment.

Modify generation of the \s-1TOC\s0 (Table Of Contents), which is created for
every executable file.  The \fB\-mfull\-toc\fR option is selected by
default.  In that case, \s-1GCC\s0 will allocate at least one \s-1TOC\s0 entry for
each unique non-automatic variable reference in your program.  \s-1GCC\s0
will also place floating-point constants in the \s-1TOC\s0.  However, only
16,384 entries are available in the \s-1TOC\s0.
.Sp
If you receive a linker error message that saying you have overflowed
the available \s-1TOC\s0 space, you can reduce the amount of \s-1TOC\s0 space used
with the \fB\-mno\-fp\-in\-toc\fR and \fB\-mno\-sum\-in\-toc\fR options.
\&\fB\-mno\-fp\-in\-toc\fR prevents \s-1GCC\s0 from putting floating-point
constants in the \s-1TOC\s0 and \fB\-mno\-sum\-in\-toc\fR forces \s-1GCC\s0 to
generate code to calculate the sum of an address and a constant at
run-time instead of putting that sum into the \s-1TOC\s0.  You may specify one
or both of these options.  Each causes \s-1GCC\s0 to produce very slightly
slower and larger code at the expense of conserving \s-1TOC\s0 space.
.Sp
If you still run out of space in the \s-1TOC\s0 even when you specify both of
these options, specify \fB\-mminimal\-toc\fR instead.  This option causes
\&\s-1GCC\s0 to make only one \s-1TOC\s0 entry for every file.  When you specify this
option, \s-1GCC\s0 will produce code that is slower and larger but which
uses extremely little \s-1TOC\s0 space.  You may wish to use this option

Produce code that conforms more closely to \s-1IBM\s0 \s-1XL\s0 compiler semantics
when using AIX-compatible \s-1ABI\s0.  Pass floating-point arguments to
prototyped functions beyond the register save area (\s-1RSA\s0) on the stack
in addition to argument FPRs.  Do not assume that most significant
double in 128\-bit long double value is properly rounded when comparing
values and converting to double.  Use \s-1XL\s0 symbol names for long double
support routines.
.Sp
The \s-1AIX\s0 calling convention was extended but not initially documented to
handle an obscure K&R C case of calling a function that takes the
address of its arguments with fewer arguments than declared.  \s-1IBM\s0 \s-1XL\s0
compilers access floating point arguments which do not fit in the
\&\s-1RSA\s0 from the stack when a subroutine is compiled without
optimization.  Because always storing floating-point arguments on the

.IX Item "-mhard-float"
.PD
Generate code that does not use (uses) the floating-point register set.
Software floating point emulation is provided if you use the
\&\fB\-msoft\-float\fR option, and pass the option to \s-1GCC\s0 when linking.
.IP "\fB\-mmultiple\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mmultiple"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-multiple\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-multiple"
.PD
Generate code that uses (does not use) the load multiple word
instructions and the store multiple word instructions.  These
instructions are generated by default on \s-1POWER\s0 systems, and not
generated on PowerPC systems.  Do not use \fB\-mmultiple\fR on little
endian PowerPC systems, since those instructions do not work when the
processor is in little endian mode.  The exceptions are \s-1PPC740\s0 and
\&\s-1PPC750\s0 which permit the instructions usage in little endian mode.

.IX Item "-mno-string"
.PD
Generate code that uses (does not use) the load string instructions
and the store string word instructions to save multiple registers and
do small block moves.  These instructions are generated by default on
\&\s-1POWER\s0 systems, and not generated on PowerPC systems.  Do not use
\&\fB\-mstring\fR on little endian PowerPC systems, since those
instructions do not work when the processor is in little endian mode.
The exceptions are \s-1PPC740\s0 and \s-1PPC750\s0 which permit the instructions
usage in little endian mode.

.IP "\fB\-mno\-update\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-update"
.PD
Generate code that uses (does not use) the load or store instructions
that update the base register to the address of the calculated memory
location.  These instructions are generated by default.  If you use
\&\fB\-mno\-update\fR, there is a small window between the time that the
stack pointer is updated and the address of the previous frame is
stored, which means code that walks the stack frame across interrupts or
signals may get corrupted data.

Generate code that uses (does not use) the half-word multiply and
multiply-accumulate instructions on the \s-1IBM\s0 405 and 440 processors.
These instructions are generated by default when targetting those
processors.

Generate code that uses (does not use) the string-search \fBdlmzb\fR
instruction on the \s-1IBM\s0 405 and 440 processors.  This instruction is
generated by default when targetting those processors.

.PD
On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do not (do) force structures
and unions that contain bit-fields to be aligned to the base type of the
bit-field.
.Sp
For example, by default a structure containing nothing but 8
\&\f(CW\*(C`unsigned\*(C'\fR bit-fields of length 1 would be aligned to a 4 byte
boundary and have a size of 4 bytes.  By using \fB\-mno\-bit\-align\fR,
the structure would be aligned to a 1 byte boundary and be one byte in
size.

On embedded PowerPC systems generate code that allows (does not allow)
the program to be relocated to a different address at runtime.  If you
use \fB\-mrelocatable\fR on any module, all objects linked together must
be compiled with \fB\-mrelocatable\fR or \fB\-mrelocatable\-lib\fR.

On embedded PowerPC systems generate code that allows (does not allow)
the program to be relocated to a different address at runtime.  Modules
compiled with \fB\-mrelocatable\-lib\fR can be linked with either modules
compiled without \fB\-mrelocatable\fR and \fB\-mrelocatable\-lib\fR or
