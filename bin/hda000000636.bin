5.50.10 SPARC VIS Built-in Functions
------------------------------------

GCC supports SIMD operations on the SPARC using both the generic vector
extensions (*note Vector Extensions::) as well as built-in functions for
the SPARC Visual Instruction Set (VIS).  When you use the `-mvis'
switch, the VIS extension is exposed as the following built-in
functions:

     typedef int v2si __attribute__ ((vector_size (8)));
     typedef short v4hi __attribute__ ((vector_size (8)));
     typedef short v2hi __attribute__ ((vector_size (4)));
     typedef char v8qi __attribute__ ((vector_size (8)));
     typedef char v4qi __attribute__ ((vector_size (4)));

     void * __builtin_vis_alignaddr (void *, long);
     int64_t __builtin_vis_faligndatadi (int64_t, int64_t);
     v2si __builtin_vis_faligndatav2si (v2si, v2si);
     v4hi __builtin_vis_faligndatav4hi (v4si, v4si);
     v8qi __builtin_vis_faligndatav8qi (v8qi, v8qi);

     v4hi __builtin_vis_fexpand (v4qi);

     v4hi __builtin_vis_fmul8x16 (v4qi, v4hi);
     v4hi __builtin_vis_fmul8x16au (v4qi, v4hi);
     v4hi __builtin_vis_fmul8x16al (v4qi, v4hi);

5.50.11 SPU Built-in Functions
------------------------------

GCC provides extensions for the SPU processor as described in the
Sony/Toshiba/IBM SPU Language Extensions Specification, which can be
found at `http://cell.scei.co.jp/' or
`http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/power/cell/'.  GCC's implementation
differs in several ways.

   * The optional extension of specifying vector constants in
     parentheses is not supported.

   * A vector initializer requires no cast if the vector constant is of
     the same type as the variable it is initializing.

   * If `signed' or `unsigned' is omitted, the signedness of the vector
     type is the default signedness of the base type.  The default
     varies depending on the operating system, so a portable program
     should always specify the signedness.

   * By default, the keyword `__vector' is added. The macro `vector' is
     defined in `<spu_intrinsics.h>' and can be undefined.

   * GCC allows using a `typedef' name as the type specifier for a
     vector type.

   * For C, overloaded functions are implemented with macros so the
     following does not work:

            spu_add ((vector signed int){1, 2, 3, 4}, foo);

     Since `spu_add' is a macro, the vector constant in the example is
     treated as four separate arguments.  Wrap the entire argument in
     parentheses for this to work.

   * The extended version of `__builtin_expect' is not supported.


 _Note:_ Only the interface described in the aforementioned
specification is supported. Internally, GCC uses built-in functions to
implement the required functionality, but these are not supported and
are subject to change without notice.

5.51 Format Checks Specific to Particular Target Machines
=========================================================

For some target machines, GCC supports additional options to the format
attribute (*note Declaring Attributes of Functions: Function
Attributes.).

* Menu:

* Solaris Format Checks::


File: gcc.info,  Node: Solaris Format Checks,  Up: Target Format Checks

5.51.1 Solaris Format Checks
----------------------------

Solaris targets support the `cmn_err' (or `__cmn_err__') format check.
`cmn_err' accepts a subset of the standard `printf' conversions, and
the two-argument `%b' conversion for displaying bit-fields.  See the
Solaris man page for `cmn_err' for more information.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Pragmas,  Next: Unnamed Fields,  Prev: Target Format Checks,  Up: C Extensions

5.52 Pragmas Accepted by GCC
============================

GCC supports several types of pragmas, primarily in order to compile
code originally written for other compilers.  Note that in general we
do not recommend the use of pragmas; *Note Function Attributes::, for
further explanation.

* Menu:

* ARM Pragmas::
* M32C Pragmas::
* RS/6000 and PowerPC Pragmas::
* Darwin Pragmas::
* Solaris Pragmas::

* Visibility Pragmas::


File: gcc.info,  Node: ARM Pragmas,  Next: M32C Pragmas,  Up: Pragmas

5.52.1 ARM Pragmas
------------------

The ARM target defines pragmas for controlling the default addition of
`long_call' and `short_call' attributes to functions.  *Note Function
Attributes::, for information about the effects of these attributes.

`long_calls'
     Set all subsequent functions to have the `long_call' attribute.

`no_long_calls'
     Set all subsequent functions to have the `short_call' attribute.

`long_calls_off'
     Do not affect the `long_call' or `short_call' attributes of
     subsequent functions.


File: gcc.info,  Node: M32C Pragmas,  Next: RS/6000 and PowerPC Pragmas,  Prev: ARM Pragmas,  Up: Pragmas

5.52.2 M32C Pragmas
-------------------

`memregs NUMBER'
     Overrides the command line option `-memregs=' for the current
     file.  Use with care!  This pragma must be before any function in
     the file, and mixing different memregs values in different objects
     may make them incompatible.  This pragma is useful when a
     performance-critical function uses a memreg for temporary values,
     as it may allow you to reduce the number of memregs used.



File: gcc.info,  Node: RS/6000 and PowerPC Pragmas,  Next: Darwin Pragmas,  Prev: M32C Pragmas,  Up: Pragmas

5.52.3 RS/6000 and PowerPC Pragmas
----------------------------------

The RS/6000 and PowerPC targets define one pragma for controlling
whether or not the `longcall' attribute is added to function
declarations by default.  This pragma overrides the `-mlongcall'
option, but not the `longcall' and `shortcall' attributes.  *Note
RS/6000 and PowerPC Options::, for more information about when long
calls are and are not necessary.

`longcall (1)'
     Apply the `longcall' attribute to all subsequent function
     declarations.

`longcall (0)'
     Do not apply the `longcall' attribute to subsequent function
     declarations.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Darwin Pragmas,  Next: Solaris Pragmas,  Prev: RS/6000 and PowerPC Pragmas,  Up: Pragmas

5.52.4 Darwin Pragmas
---------------------

The following pragmas are available for all architectures running the
Darwin operating system.  These are useful for compatibility with other
Mac OS compilers.

`mark TOKENS...'
     This pragma is accepted, but has no effect.

`options align=ALIGNMENT'
     This pragma sets the alignment of fields in structures.  The
     values of ALIGNMENT may be `mac68k', to emulate m68k alignment, or
     `power', to emulate PowerPC alignment.  Uses of this pragma nest
     properly; to restore the previous setting, use `reset' for the
     ALIGNMENT.

`segment TOKENS...'
     This pragma is accepted, but has no effect.

`unused (VAR [, VAR]...)'
     This pragma declares variables to be possibly unused.  GCC will not
     produce warnings for the listed variables.  The effect is similar
     to that of the `unused' attribute, except that this pragma may
     appear anywhere within the variables' scopes.

5.52.5 Solaris Pragmas
----------------------

The Solaris target supports `#pragma redefine_extname' (*note
Symbol-Renaming Pragmas::).  It also supports additional `#pragma'
directives for compatibility with the system compiler.

`align ALIGNMENT (VARIABLE [, VARIABLE]...)'
     Increase the minimum alignment of each VARIABLE to ALIGNMENT.
     This is the same as GCC's `aligned' attribute *note Variable
     Attributes::).  Macro expansion occurs on the arguments to this
     pragma when compiling C and Objective-C.  It does not currently
     occur when compiling C++, but this is a bug which may be fixed in
     a future release.

`fini (FUNCTION [, FUNCTION]...)'
     This pragma causes each listed FUNCTION to be called after main,
     or during shared module unloading, by adding a call to the `.fini'
     section.

`init (FUNCTION [, FUNCTION]...)'
     This pragma causes each listed FUNCTION to be called during
     initialization (before `main') or during shared module loading, by
     adding a call to the `.init' section.

5.52.6 Symbol-Renaming Pragmas
------------------------------

For compatibility with the Solaris and Tru64 UNIX system headers, GCC
supports two `#pragma' directives which change the name used in
assembly for a given declaration.  These pragmas are only available on
platforms whose system headers need them.  To get this effect on all
platforms supported by GCC, use the asm labels extension (*note Asm
Labels::).

`redefine_extname OLDNAME NEWNAME'
     This pragma gives the C function OLDNAME the assembly symbol
     NEWNAME.  The preprocessor macro `__PRAGMA_REDEFINE_EXTNAME' will
     be defined if this pragma is available (currently only on Solaris).

`extern_prefix STRING'
     This pragma causes all subsequent external function and variable
     declarations to have STRING prepended to their assembly symbols.
     This effect may be terminated with another `extern_prefix' pragma
     whose argument is an empty string.  The preprocessor macro
     `__PRAGMA_EXTERN_PREFIX' will be defined if this pragma is
     available (currently only on Tru64 UNIX).

 These pragmas and the asm labels extension interact in a complicated
manner.  Here are some corner cases you may want to be aware of.

  1. Both pragmas silently apply only to declarations with external
     linkage.  Asm labels do not have this restriction.

  2. In C++, both pragmas silently apply only to declarations with "C"
     linkage.  Again, asm labels do not have this restriction.

  3. If any of the three ways of changing the assembly name of a
     declaration is applied to a declaration whose assembly name has
     already been determined (either by a previous use of one of these
     features, or because the compiler needed the assembly name in
     order to generate code), and the new name is different, a warning
     issues and the name does not change.

  4. The OLDNAME used by `#pragma redefine_extname' is always the
     C-language name.

  5. If `#pragma extern_prefix' is in effect, and a declaration occurs
     with an asm label attached, the prefix is silently ignored for
     that declaration.

  6. If `#pragma extern_prefix' and `#pragma redefine_extname' apply to
     the same declaration, whichever triggered first wins, and a
     warning issues if they contradict each other.  (We would like to
     have `#pragma redefine_extname' always win, for consistency with
     asm labels, but if `#pragma extern_prefix' triggers first we have
     no way of knowing that that happened.)
