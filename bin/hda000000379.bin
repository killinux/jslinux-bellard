In C, allocate even uninitialized global variables in the data section of the

two different compilations, you will get an error when you link them.

This switch causes the command line that was used to invoke the
compiler to be recorded into the object file that is being created.
This switch is only implemented on some targets and the exact format
of the recording is target and binary file format dependent, but it
usually takes the form of a section containing \s-1ASCII\s0 text.  This
switch is related to the \fB\-fverbose\-asm\fR switch, but that
switch only records information in the assembler output file as
comments, so it never reaches the object file.
.IP "\fB\-fpic\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpic"
Generate position-independent code (\s-1PIC\s0) suitable for use in a shared
library, if supported for the target machine.  Such code accesses all
constant addresses through a global offset table (\s-1GOT\s0).  The dynamic
loader resolves the \s-1GOT\s0 entries when the program starts (the dynamic
loader is not part of \s-1GCC\s0; it is part of the operating system).  If
the \s-1GOT\s0 size for the linked executable exceeds a machine-specific
maximum size, you get an error message from the linker indicating that
\&\fB\-fpic\fR does not work; in that case, recompile with \fB\-fPIC\fR
instead.  (These maximums are 8k on the \s-1SPARC\s0 and 32k
on the m68k and \s-1RS/6000\s0.  The 386 has no such limit.)
.Sp
Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.  For the 386, \s-1GCC\s0 supports \s-1PIC\s0 for System V
but not for the Sun 386i.  Code generated for the \s-1IBM\s0 \s-1RS/6000\s0 is always
position-independent.

Generate instrumentation calls for entry and exit to functions.  Just
after function entry and just before function exit, the following
profiling functions will be called with the address of the current
function and its call site.  (On some platforms,
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_builtin_return_address\*(C'\fR does not work beyond the current
function, so the call site information may not be available to the
profiling functions otherwise.)

.Ve
.Sp
The first argument is the address of the start of the current function,
which may be looked up exactly in the symbol table.
.Sp
This instrumentation is also done for functions expanded inline in other
functions.  The profiling calls will indicate where, conceptually, the
inline function is entered and exited.  This means that addressable
versions of such functions must be available.  If all your uses of a
function are expanded inline, this may mean an additional expansion of
code size.  If you use \fBextern inline\fR in your C code, an
addressable version of such functions must be provided.  (This is
normally the case anyways, but if you get lucky and the optimizer always
expands the functions inline, you might have gotten away without
providing static copies.)
.Sp
A function may be given the attribute \f(CW\*(C`no_instrument_function\*(C'\fR, in
which case this instrumentation will not be done.  This can be used, for
example, for the profiling functions listed above, high-priority
interrupt routines, and any functions from which the profiling functions
cannot safely be called (perhaps signal handlers, if the profiling
routines generate output or allocate memory).
.IP "\fB\-finstrument\-functions\-exclude\-file\-list=\fR\fIfile\fR\fB,\fR\fIfile\fR\fB,...\fR" 4
.IX Item "-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=file,file,..."
Set the list of functions that are excluded from instrumentation (see
the description of \f(CW\*(C`\-finstrument\-functions\*(C'\fR).  If the file that
contains a function definition matches with one of \fIfile\fR, then
that function is not instrumented.  The match is done on substrings:
if the \fIfile\fR parameter is a substring of the file name, it is
considered to be a match.
.Sp
For example,
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-finstrument\-functions\-exclude\-file\-list=/bits/stl,include/sys\*(C'\fR

contain \f(CW\*(C`/bits/stl\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`include/sys\*(C'\fR.

This is similar to \f(CW\*(C`\-finstrument\-functions\-exclude\-file\-list\*(C'\fR,
but this option sets the list of function names to be excluded from
instrumentation.  The function name to be matched is its user-visible
name, such as \f(CW\*(C`vector<int> blah(const vector<int> &)\*(C'\fR, not the
internal mangled name (e.g., \f(CW\*(C`_Z4blahRSt6vectorIiSaIiEE\*(C'\fR).  The

of the function name, it is considered to be a match.

Generate code to verify that you do not go beyond the boundary of the

a single-threaded environment since stack overflow is automatically
detected on nearly all systems if there is only one stack.
.Sp
Note that this switch does not actually cause checking to be done; the
operating system must do that.  The switch causes generation of code
to ensure that the operating system sees the stack being extended.

Generate code to ensure that the stack does not grow beyond a certain value,
either the value of a register or the address of a symbol.  If the stack
would grow beyond the value, a signal is raised.  For most targets,
the signal is raised before the stack overruns the boundary, so
it is possible to catch the signal without taking special precautions.
.Sp
For instance, if the stack starts at absolute address \fB0x80000000\fR
and grows downwards, you can use the flags
\&\fB\-fstack\-limit\-symbol=_\|_stack_limit\fR and

.IX Item "-fvisibility=default|internal|hidden|protected"
Set the default \s-1ELF\s0 image symbol visibility to the specified option\-\-\-all
symbols will be marked with this unless overridden within the code.
Using this feature can very substantially improve linking and
load times of shared object libraries, produce more optimized
code, provide near-perfect \s-1API\s0 export and prevent symbol clashes.
It is \fBstrongly\fR recommended that you use this in any shared objects
you distribute.
.Sp
Despite the nomenclature, \f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR always means public ie;
available to be linked against from outside the shared object.
\&\f(CW\*(C`protected\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`internal\*(C'\fR are pretty useless in real-world
usage so the only other commonly used option will be \f(CW\*(C`hidden\*(C'\fR.
The default if \fB\-fvisibility\fR isn't specified is
\&\f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR, i.e., make every
symbol public\-\-\-this causes the same behavior as previous versions of
\&\s-1GCC\s0.
.Sp
A good explanation of the benefits offered by ensuring \s-1ELF\s0
symbols have the correct visibility is given by \*(L"How To Write
Shared Libraries\*(R" by Ulrich Drepper (which can be found at
<\fBhttp://people.redhat.com/~drepper/\fR>)\-\-\-however a superior
solution made possible by this option to marking things hidden when
the default is public is to make the default hidden and mark things
public.  This is the norm with \s-1DLL\s0's on Windows and with \fB\-fvisibility=hidden\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_attribute_\|_ ((visibility("default")))\*(C'\fR instead of
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_declspec(dllexport)\*(C'\fR you get almost identical semantics with
identical syntax.  This is a great boon to those working with
cross-platform projects.
.Sp
For those adding visibility support to existing code, you may find
\&\fB#pragma \s-1GCC\s0 visibility\fR of use.  This works by you enclosing
the declarations you wish to set visibility for with (for example)
\&\fB#pragma \s-1GCC\s0 visibility push(hidden)\fR and
\&\fB#pragma \s-1GCC\s0 visibility pop\fR.
Bear in mind that symbol visibility should be viewed \fBas
part of the \s-1API\s0 interface contract\fR and thus all new code should
always specify visibility when it is not the default ie; declarations
only for use within the local \s-1DSO\s0 should \fBalways\fR be marked explicitly
as hidden as so to avoid \s-1PLT\s0 indirection overheads\-\-\-making this
abundantly clear also aids readability and self-documentation of the code.
Note that due to \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+ specification requirements, operator new and
operator delete must always be of default visibility.
.Sp
Be aware that headers from outside your project, in particular system
headers and headers from any other library you use, may not be
expecting to be compiled with visibility other than the default.  You
may need to explicitly say \fB#pragma \s-1GCC\s0 visibility push(default)\fR
before including any such headers.
.Sp
\&\fBextern\fR declarations are not affected by \fB\-fvisibility\fR, so
a lot of code can be recompiled with \fB\-fvisibility=hidden\fR with
no modifications.  However, this means that calls to \fBextern\fR
functions with no explicit visibility will use the \s-1PLT\s0, so it is more
effective to use \fB_\|_attribute ((visibility))\fR and/or
\&\fB#pragma \s-1GCC\s0 visibility\fR to tell the compiler which \fBextern\fR
declarations should be treated as hidden.
.Sp
Note that \fB\-fvisibility\fR does affect \*(C+ vague linkage
entities. This means that, for instance, an exception class that will
be thrown between DSOs must be explicitly marked with default
visibility so that the \fBtype_info\fR nodes will be unified between
the DSOs.
.Sp

is at <\fBhttp://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility\fR>.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT"
This section describes several environment variables that affect how \s-1GCC\s0

when searching for various kinds of files.  Some are used to specify other
aspects of the compilation environment.
.PP
Note that you can also specify places to search using options such as
\&\fB\-B\fR, \fB\-I\fR and \fB\-L\fR.  These
take precedence over places specified using environment variables, which
in turn take precedence over those specified by the configuration of \s-1GCC\s0.

.IX Item "LC_ALL"
.PD
These environment variables control the way that \s-1GCC\s0 uses
localization information that allow \s-1GCC\s0 to work with different
national conventions.  \s-1GCC\s0 inspects the locale categories
\&\fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR and \fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR if it has been configured to do
so.  These locale categories can be set to any value supported by your
installation.  A typical value is \fBen_GB.UTF\-8\fR for English in the United
Kingdom encoded in \s-1UTF\-8\s0.
.Sp
The \fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR environment variable specifies character
classification.  \s-1GCC\s0 uses it to determine the character boundaries in
a string; this is needed for some multibyte encodings that contain quote
and escape characters that would otherwise be interpreted as a string
end or escape.
.Sp
The \fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR environment variable specifies the language to
use in diagnostic messages.
.Sp
If the \fB\s-1LC_ALL\s0\fR environment variable is set, it overrides the value
of \fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR and \fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR; otherwise, \fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR
and \fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR default to the value of the \fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR
environment variable.  If none of these variables are set, \s-1GCC\s0
defaults to traditional C English behavior.
.IP "\fB\s-1TMPDIR\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "TMPDIR"
If \fB\s-1TMPDIR\s0\fR is set, it specifies the directory to use for temporary
files.  \s-1GCC\s0 uses temporary files to hold the output of one stage of
compilation which is to be used as input to the next stage: for example,
the output of the preprocessor, which is the input to the compiler
proper.
.IP "\fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "GCC_EXEC_PREFIX"
If \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR is set, it specifies a prefix to use in the
names of the subprograms executed by the compiler.  No slash is added
when this prefix is combined with the name of a subprogram, but you can
specify a prefix that ends with a slash if you wish.
.Sp
If \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR is not set, \s-1GCC\s0 will attempt to figure out
an appropriate prefix to use based on the pathname it was invoked with.
.Sp
If \s-1GCC\s0 cannot find the subprogram using the specified prefix, it
tries looking in the usual places for the subprogram.
.Sp
The default value of \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR is
\&\fI\fIprefix\fI/lib/gcc/\fR where \fIprefix\fR is the prefix to
the installed compiler. In many cases \fIprefix\fR is the value
of \f(CW\*(C`prefix\*(C'\fR when you ran the \fIconfigure\fR script.
.Sp
Other prefixes specified with \fB\-B\fR take precedence over this prefix.
.Sp
This prefix is also used for finding files such as \fIcrt0.o\fR that are
used for linking.
.Sp
In addition, the prefix is used in an unusual way in finding the
directories to search for header files.  For each of the standard
directories whose name normally begins with \fB/usr/local/lib/gcc\fR
(more precisely, with the value of \fB\s-1GCC_INCLUDE_DIR\s0\fR), \s-1GCC\s0 tries
replacing that beginning with the specified prefix to produce an
alternate directory name.  Thus, with \fB\-Bfoo/\fR, \s-1GCC\s0 will search
\&\fIfoo/bar\fR where it would normally search \fI/usr/local/lib/bar\fR.
These alternate directories are searched first; the standard directories
come next. If a standard directory begins with the configured
\&\fIprefix\fR then the value of \fIprefix\fR is replaced by
\&\fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR when looking for header files.
.IP "\fB\s-1COMPILER_PATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "COMPILER_PATH"
The value of \fB\s-1COMPILER_PATH\s0\fR is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like \fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR.  \s-1GCC\s0 tries the directories thus

.IP "\fB\s-1LIBRARY_PATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LIBRARY_PATH"
The value of \fB\s-1LIBRARY_PATH\s0\fR is a colon-separated list of

\&\s-1GCC\s0 tries the directories thus specified when searching for special
linker files, if it can't find them using \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR.  Linking
using \s-1GCC\s0 also uses these directories when searching for ordinary
libraries for the \fB\-l\fR option (but directories specified with
\&\fB\-L\fR come first).
.IP "\fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LANG"
This variable is used to pass locale information to the compiler.  One way in
which this information is used is to determine the character set to be used
when character literals, string literals and comments are parsed in C and \*(C+.

the following values for \fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR are recognized:

.PD
Each variable's value is a list of directories separated by a special
character, much like \fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR, in which to look for header files.
The special character, \f(CW\*(C`PATH_SEPARATOR\*(C'\fR, is target-dependent and
determined at \s-1GCC\s0 build time.  For Microsoft Windows-based targets it is a
semicolon, and for almost all other targets it is a colon.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1CPATH\s0\fR specifies a list of directories to be searched as if
specified with \fB\-I\fR, but after any paths given with \fB\-I\fR
options on the command line.  This environment variable is used
regardless of which language is being preprocessed.
.Sp
The remaining environment variables apply only when preprocessing the
particular language indicated.  Each specifies a list of directories
to be searched as if specified with \fB\-isystem\fR, but after any
paths given with \fB\-isystem\fR options on the command line.
.Sp
In all these variables, an empty element instructs the compiler to
search its current working directory.  Empty elements can appear at the
beginning or end of a path.  For instance, if the value of
\&\fB\s-1CPATH\s0\fR is \f(CW\*(C`:/special/include\*(C'\fR, that has the same
effect as \fB\-I.\ \-I/special/include\fR.
.IP "\fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT"
If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output
dependencies for Make based on the non-system header files processed
by the compiler.  System header files are ignored in the dependency
output.
.Sp
The value of \fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR can be just a file name, in
which case the Make rules are written to that file, guessing the target
name from the source file name.  Or the value can have the form
\&\fIfile\fR\fB \fR\fItarget\fR, in which case the rules are written to
file \fIfile\fR using \fItarget\fR as the target name.
.Sp
In other words, this environment variable is equivalent to combining
the options \fB\-MM\fR and \fB\-MF\fR,
with an optional \fB\-MT\fR switch too.
.IP "\fB\s-1SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES"
This variable is the same as \fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR (see above),
except that system header files are not ignored, so it implies
\&\fB\-M\fR rather than \fB\-MM\fR.  However, the dependence on the
main input file is omitted.

On some systems, \fBgcc \-shared\fR
needs to build supplementary stub code for constructors to work.  On
multi-libbed systems, \fBgcc \-shared\fR must select the correct support
libraries to link against.  Failing to supply the correct flags may lead
to subtle defects.  Supplying them in cases where they are not necessary
is innocuous.

.SH NAME
make \- GNU make utility to maintain groups of programs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "make "
[
.B \-f
.I makefile
] [ options ] ... [ targets ] ...
.SH WARNING
This man page is an extract of the documentation of GNU
.IR make .
It is updated only occasionally, because the GNU project does not use nroff.
For complete, current documentation, refer to the Info file
.B make.info
which is made from the Texinfo source file
.BR make.texi .
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The purpose of the
.I make
utility is to determine automatically which
pieces of a large program need to be recompiled, and issue the commands to
recompile them.
The manual describes the GNU implementation of
.IR make ,
which was written by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath, and is
currently maintained by Paul Smith.
Our examples show C programs, since they are most common, but you can use
.I make
with any programming language whose compiler can be run with a
shell command.
In fact,
.I make
is not limited to programs.
You can use it to describe any task where some files must be
updated automatically from others whenever the others change.
.LP
To prepare to use
.IR make ,
you must write a file called the
.I makefile
that describes the relationships among files in your program, and the
states the commands for updating each file.
In a program, typically the executable file is updated from object
files, which are in turn made by compiling source files.
.LP
Once a suitable makefile exists, each time you change some source files,
this simple shell command:
.sp 1
.RS
.B make
.RE
.sp 1
suffices to perform all necessary recompilations.
The
.I make
program uses the makefile data base and the last-modification times
of the files to decide which of the files need to be updated.
For each of those files, it issues the commands recorded in the data base.
.LP
.I make
executes commands in the
.I makefile
to update
one or more target
.IR names ,
where
.I name
is typically a program.
If no
.B \-f
option is present,
.I make
will look for the makefiles
.IR GNUmakefile ,
.IR makefile ,
and
.IR Makefile ,
in that order.
.LP
Normally you should call your makefile either
.I makefile
or
.IR Makefile .
(We recommend
.I Makefile
because it appears prominently near the beginning of a directory
listing, right near other important files such as
.IR  README .)
The first name checked,
.IR GNUmakefile ,
is not recommended for most makefiles.
You should use this name if you have a makefile that is specific to GNU
.IR make ,
and will not be understood by other versions of
.IR make .
If
.I makefile
is `\-', the standard input is read.
.LP
.I make
updates a target if it depends on prerequisite files
that have been modified since the target was last modified,
or if the target does not exist.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp 1
.TP 0.5i
.BR \-b , " \-m"
These options are ignored for compatibility with other versions of
.IR make .
.TP 0.5i
.BR \-B , " \-\-always\-make"
Unconditionally make all targets.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-C\fR \fIdir\fR, \fB\-\-directory\fR=\fIdir\fR
Change to directory
.I dir
before reading the makefiles or doing anything else.
If multiple
.B \-C
options are specified, each is interpreted relative to the
previous one:
.BR "\-C " /
.BR "\-C " etc
is equivalent to
.BR "\-C " /etc.
This is typically used with recursive invocations of
.IR make .
.TP 0.5i
.B \-d
Print debugging information in addition to normal processing.
The debugging information says which files are being considered for
remaking, which file-times are being compared and with what results,
which files actually need to be remade, which implicit rules are
considered and which are applied---everything interesting about how
.I make
decides what to do.
.TP 0.5i
.BI \-\-debug "[=FLAGS]"
Print debugging information in addition to normal processing.
If the
.I FLAGS
are omitted, then the behavior is the same as if
.B \-d
was specified.
.I FLAGS
may be
.I a
for all debugging output (same as using
.BR \-d ),
.I b
for basic debugging,
.I v
for more verbose basic debugging,
.I i
for showing implicit rules,
.I j
for details on invocation of commands, and
.I m
for debugging while remaking makefiles.
.TP 0.5i
.BR \-e , " \-\-environment\-overrides"
Give variables taken from the environment precedence
over variables from makefiles.
.TP 0.5i
+\fB\-f\fR \fIfile\fR, \fB\-\-file\fR=\fIfile\fR, \fB\-\-makefile\fR=\fIFILE\fR
Use
.I file
as a makefile.
.TP 0.5i
.BR \-i , " \-\-ignore\-errors"
Ignore all errors in commands executed to remake files.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-I\fR \fIdir\fR, \fB\-\-include\-dir\fR=\fIdir\fR
Specifies a directory
.I dir
to search for included makefiles.
If several
.B \-I
options are used to specify several directories, the directories are
searched in the order specified.
Unlike the arguments to other flags of
.IR make ,
directories given with
.B \-I
flags may come directly after the flag:
.BI \-I dir
is allowed, as well as
.BI "\-I " dir.
This syntax is allowed for compatibility with the C
preprocessor's
.B \-I
flag.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-j\fR [\fIjobs\fR], \fB\-\-jobs\fR[=\fIjobs\fR]
Specifies the number of
.I jobs
(commands) to run simultaneously.
If there is more than one
.B \-j
option, the last one is effective.
If the
.B \-j
option is given without an argument,
.IR make
will not limit the number of jobs that can run simultaneously.
.TP 0.5i
.BR \-k , " \-\-keep\-going"
Continue as much as possible after an error.
While the target that failed, and those that depend on it, cannot
be remade, the other dependencies of these targets can be processed
all the same.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-l\fR [\fIload\fR], \fB\-\-load\-average\fR[=\fIload\fR]
Specifies that no new jobs (commands) should be started if there are
others jobs running and the load average is at least
.I load
(a floating-point number).
With no argument, removes a previous load limit.
.TP 0.5i
.BR \-L , " \-\-check\-symlink\-times"
Use the latest mtime between symlinks and target.
.TP 0.5i
.BR \-n , " \-\-just\-print" , " \-\-dry\-run" , " \-\-recon"
Print the commands that would be executed, but do not execute them.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-o\fR \fIfile\fR, \fB\-\-old\-file\fR=\fIfile\fR, \fB\-\-assume\-old\fR=\fIfile\fR
Do not remake the file
.I file
even if it is older than its dependencies, and do not remake anything
on account of changes in
.IR file .
Essentially the file is treated as very old and its rules are ignored.
.TP 0.5i
.BR \-p , " \-\-print\-data\-base"
Print the data base (rules and variable values) that results from
reading the makefiles; then execute as usual or as otherwise
specified.
This also prints the version information given by the
.B \-v
switch (see below).
To print the data base without trying to remake any files, use
.B make
.B \-p
.BI \-f /dev/null.
.TP 0.5i
.BR \-q , " \-\-question"
``Question mode''.
Do not run any commands, or print anything; just return an exit status
that is zero if the specified targets are already up to date, nonzero
otherwise.
.TP 0.5i
.BR \-r , " \-\-no\-builtin\-rules"
Eliminate use of the built\-in implicit rules.
Also clear out the default list of suffixes for suffix rules.
.TP 0.5i
.BR \-R , " \-\-no\-builtin\-variables"
Don't define any built\-in variables.
.TP 0.5i
.BR \-s , " \-\-silent" , " \-\-quiet"
Silent operation; do not print the commands as they are executed.
.TP 0.5i
.BR \-S , " \-\-no\-keep\-going" , " \-\-stop"
Cancel the effect of the
.B \-k
option.
This is never necessary except in a recursive
.I make
where
.B \-k
might be inherited from the top-level
.I make
via MAKEFLAGS or if you set
.B \-k
in MAKEFLAGS in your environment.
.TP 0.5i
.BR \-t , " \-\-touch"
Touch files (mark them up to date without really changing them)
instead of running their commands.
This is used to pretend that the commands were done, in order to fool
future invocations of
.IR make .
.TP 0.5i
.BR \-v , " \-\-version"
Print the version of the
.I make
program plus a copyright, a list of authors and a notice that there
is no warranty.
.TP 0.5i
.BR \-w , " \-\-print\-directory"
Print a message containing the working directory
before and after other processing.
This may be useful for tracking down errors from complicated nests of
recursive
.I make
commands.
.TP 0.5i
.B \-\-no\-print\-directory
Turn off
.BR \-w ,
even if it was turned on implicitly.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-W\fR \fIfile\fR, \fB\-\-what\-if\fR=\fIfile\fR, \fB\-\-new\-file\fR=\fIfile\fR, \fB\-\-assume\-new\fR=\fIfile\fR
Pretend that the target
.I file
has just been modified.
When used with the
.B \-n
flag, this shows you what would happen if you were to modify that file.
Without
.BR \-n ,
it is almost the same as running a
.I touch
command on the given file before running
.IR make ,
except that the modification time is changed only in the imagination of
.IR make .
.TP 0.5i
.B \-\-warn\-undefined\-variables
Warn when an undefined variable is referenced.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
GNU
.I make
exits with a status of zero if all makefiles were successfully parsed
and no targets that were built failed.  A status of one will be returned
if the
.B \-q
flag was used and
.I make
determines that a target needs to be rebuilt.  A status of two will be
returned if any errors were encountered.

Only the most useful options are listed here; see below for the
remainder.  \fBg++\fR accepts mostly the same options as \fBgcc\fR.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
When you invoke \s-1GCC\s0, it normally does preprocessing, compilation,
assembly and linking.  The \*(L"overall options\*(R" allow you to stop this
process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the \fB\-c\fR option
says not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files
output by the assembler.
.PP
Other options are passed on to one stage of processing.  Some options
control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.  Yet other
options control the assembler and linker; most of these are not
documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.
.PP
Most of the command line options that you can use with \s-1GCC\s0 are useful
for C programs; when an option is only useful with another language
(usually \*(C+), the explanation says so explicitly.  If the description
for a particular option does not mention a source language, you can use
that option with all supported languages.
.PP
The \fBgcc\fR program accepts options and file names as operands.  Many
options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter options
may \fInot\fR be grouped: \fB\-dr\fR is very different from \fB\-d\ \-r\fR.
.PP
You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the order
you use doesn't matter.  Order does matter when you use several
options of the same kind; for example, if you specify \fB\-L\fR more
than once, the directories are searched in the order specified.  Also,
the placement of the \fB\-l\fR option is significant.
.PP
Many options have long names starting with \fB\-f\fR or with
\&\fB\-W\fR\-\-\-for example,
\&\fB\-fmove\-loop\-invariants\fR, \fB\-Wformat\fR and so on.  Most of
these have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of
\&\fB\-ffoo\fR would be \fB\-fno\-foo\fR.  This manual documents
only one of these two forms, whichever one is not the default.
