especially those where a program is held in \s-1ROM\s0, the two can be
different.  If \fB=\fR is used, the section address is set to

.IP "\fB\-\-set\-section\-flags\fR \fIsection\fR\fB=\fR\fIflags\fR" 4
.IX Item "--set-section-flags section=flags"
Set the flags for the named section.  The \fIflags\fR argument is a
comma separated string of flag names.  The recognized names are
\&\fBalloc\fR, \fBcontents\fR, \fBload\fR, \fBnoload\fR,
\&\fBreadonly\fR, \fBcode\fR, \fBdata\fR, \fBrom\fR, \fBshare\fR, and
\&\fBdebug\fR.  You can set the \fBcontents\fR flag for a section which
does not have contents, but it is not meaningful to clear the
\&\fBcontents\fR flag of a section which does have contents\*(--just remove
the section instead.  Not all flags are meaningful for all object file
formats.
.IP "\fB\-\-add\-section\fR \fIsectionname\fR\fB=\fR\fIfilename\fR" 4
.IX Item "--add-section sectionname=filename"
Add a new section named \fIsectionname\fR while copying the file.  The
contents of the new section are taken from the file \fIfilename\fR.  The
size of the section will be the size of the file.  This option only
works on file formats which can support sections with arbitrary names.
.IP "\fB\-\-rename\-section\fR \fIoldname\fR\fB=\fR\fInewname\fR\fB[,\fR\fIflags\fR\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "--rename-section oldname=newname[,flags]"
Rename a section from \fIoldname\fR to \fInewname\fR, optionally
changing the section's flags to \fIflags\fR in the process.  This has
the advantage over usng a linker script to perform the rename in that
the output stays as an object file and does not become a linked
executable.
.Sp
This option is particularly helpful when the input format is binary,
since this will always create a section called .data.  If for example,
you wanted instead to create a section called .rodata containing binary
data you could use the following command line to achieve it:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&          objcopy \-I binary \-O <output_format> \-B <architecture> \e
\&           \-\-rename\-section .data=.rodata,alloc,load,readonly,data,contents \e

.Ve
.IP "\fB\-\-long\-section\-names {enable,disable,keep}\fR" 4
.IX Item "--long-section-names {enable,disable,keep}"
Controls the handling of long section names when processing \f(CW\*(C`COFF\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`PE\-COFF\*(C'\fR object formats.  The default behaviour, \fBkeep\fR,
is to preserve long section names if any are present in the input file.
The \fBenable\fR and \fBdisable\fR options forcibly enable or disable
the use of long section names in the output object; when \fBdisable\fR
is in effect, any long section names in the input object will be truncated.
The \fBenable\fR option will only emit long section names if any are
present in the inputs; this is mostly the same as \fBkeep\fR, but it
is left undefined whether the \fBenable\fR option might force the 
creation of an empty string table in the output file.
.IP "\fB\-\-change\-leading\-char\fR" 4
.IX Item "--change-leading-char"
Some object file formats use special characters at the start of
symbols.  The most common such character is underscore, which compilers
often add before every symbol.  This option tells \fBobjcopy\fR to
change the leading character of every symbol when it converts between
object file formats.  If the object file formats use the same leading
character, this option has no effect.  Otherwise, it will add a
character, or remove a character, or change a character, as
appropriate.
.IP "\fB\-\-remove\-leading\-char\fR" 4
.IX Item "--remove-leading-char"
If the first character of a global symbol is a special symbol leading
character used by the object file format, remove the character.  The
most common symbol leading character is underscore.  This option will
remove a leading underscore from all global symbols.  This can be useful
if you want to link together objects of different file formats with
different conventions for symbol names.  This is different from
\&\fB\-\-change\-leading\-char\fR because it always changes the symbol name
when appropriate, regardless of the object file format of the output
file.
.IP "\fB\-\-reverse\-bytes=\fR\fInum\fR" 4
.IX Item "--reverse-bytes=num"
Reverse the bytes in a section with output contents.  A section length must
be evenly divisible by the value given in order for the swap to be able to
take place. Reversing takes place before the interleaving is performed.
.Sp
This option is used typically in generating \s-1ROM\s0 images for problematic
target systems.  For example, on some target boards, the 32\-bit words
fetched from 8\-bit ROMs are re-assembled in little-endian byte order
regardless of the \s-1CPU\s0 byte order.  Depending on the programming model, the
endianness of the \s-1ROM\s0 may need to be modified.
.Sp
Consider a simple file with a section containing the following eight
bytes:  \f(CW12345678\fR.
.Sp
Using \fB\-\-reverse\-bytes=2\fR for the above example, the bytes in the
output file would be ordered \f(CW21436587\fR.
.Sp
Using \fB\-\-reverse\-bytes=4\fR for the above example, the bytes in the
output file would be ordered \f(CW43218765\fR.
.Sp
By using \fB\-\-reverse\-bytes=2\fR for the above example, followed by
\&\fB\-\-reverse\-bytes=4\fR on the output file, the bytes in the second
output file would be ordered \f(CW34127856\fR.

a machine is assigned an official code and the tool-chain adopts the
new code, but other applications still depend on the original code
being used.  For \s-1ELF\s0 based architectures if the \fIindex\fR
alternative does not exist then the value is treated as an absolute

\&\fBelfedit\fR updates the \s-1ELF\s0 header of \s-1ELF\s0 files which have
the matching \s-1ELF\s0 machine and file types.  The options control how and
which fields in the \s-1ELF\s0 header should be updated.
.PP
\&\fIelffile\fR... are the \s-1ELF\s0 files to be updated.  32\-bit and
64\-bit \s-1ELF\s0 files are supported, as are archives containing \s-1ELF\s0 files.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
The long and short forms of options, shown here as alternatives, are
equivalent. At least one of the \fB\-\-output\-mach\fR,
\&\fB\-\-output\-type\fR and \fB\-\-output\-osabi\fR options must be given.

\&\fB\-\-input\-mach\fR isn't specified, it will match any \s-1ELF\s0
machine types.
.Sp
The supported \s-1ELF\s0 machine types are, \fIL1OM\fR and \fIx86\-64\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-output\-mach=\fR\fImachine\fR" 4
.IX Item "--output-mach=machine"
Change the \s-1ELF\s0 machine type in the \s-1ELF\s0 header to \fImachine\fR.  The
supported \s-1ELF\s0 machine types are the same as \fB\-\-input\-mach\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-input\-type=\fR\fItype\fR" 4
.IX Item "--input-type=type"
Set the matching input \s-1ELF\s0 file type to \fItype\fR.  If

Change the \s-1ELF\s0 file type in the \s-1ELF\s0 header to \fItype\fR.  The
supported \s-1ELF\s0 types are the same as \fB\-\-input\-type\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-input\-osabi=\fR\fIosabi\fR" 4
.IX Item "--input-osabi=osabi"
Set the matching input \s-1ELF\s0 file \s-1OSABI\s0 to \fIosbi\fR.  If
\&\fB\-\-input\-osabi\fR isn't specified, it will match any \s-1ELF\s0 OSABIs.
.Sp
The supported \s-1ELF\s0 OSABIs are, \fInone\fR, \fI\s-1HPUX\s0\fR, \fINetBSD\fR,

.IX Item "--help"
.PD
Display the command line options understood by \fBelfedit\fR.
.IP "\fB@\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "@file"
Read command-line options from \fIfile\fR.  The options read are
inserted in place of the original @\fIfile\fR option.  If \fIfile\fR
does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
literally, and not removed.
.Sp
Options in \fIfile\fR are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
with a backslash.  The \fIfile\fR may itself contain additional
@\fIfile\fR options; any such options will be processed recursively.

.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBaddr2line\fR translates addresses into file names and line numbers.
Given an address in an executable or an offset in a section of a relocatable
object, it uses the debugging information to figure out which file name and
line number are associated with it.
.PP
The executable or relocatable object to use is specified with the \fB\-e\fR
option.  The default is the file \fIa.out\fR.  The section in the relocatable
object to use is specified with the \fB\-j\fR option.
.PP
\&\fBaddr2line\fR has two modes of operation.
.PP
In the first, hexadecimal addresses are specified on the command line,
and \fBaddr2line\fR displays the file name and line number for each
address.
.PP
In the second, \fBaddr2line\fR reads hexadecimal addresses from
standard input, and prints the file name and line number for each
address on standard output.  In this mode, \fBaddr2line\fR may be used
in a pipe to convert dynamically chosen addresses.
.PP
The format of the output is \fB\s-1FILENAME:LINENO\s0\fR.  The file name and
line number for each address is printed on a separate line.  If the
\&\fB\-f\fR option is used, then each \fB\s-1FILENAME:LINENO\s0\fR line is
preceded by a \fB\s-1FUNCTIONNAME\s0\fR line which is the name of the function
containing the address.  If the \fB\-a\fR option is used, then the
address read is first printed.
.PP
If the file name or function name can not be determined,
\&\fBaddr2line\fR will print two question marks in their place.  If the
line number can not be determined, \fBaddr2line\fR will print 0.
.SH "OPTIONS"

.IP "\fB\-a\fR" 4
.IX Item "-a"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-addresses\fR" 4
.IX Item "--addresses"
.PD
Display address before function names or file and line number
information.  The address is printed with a \fB0x\fR prefix to easily
identify it.
.IP "\fB\-b\fR \fIbfdname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-b bfdname"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-target=\fR\fIbfdname\fR" 4

.IX Item "-C"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-demangle[=\fR\fIstyle\fR\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "--demangle[=style]"
.PD
Decode (\fIdemangle\fR) low-level symbol names into user-level names.
Besides removing any initial underscore prepended by the system, this
makes \*(C+ function names readable.  Different compilers have different
mangling styles. The optional demangling style argument can be used to
choose an appropriate demangling style for your compiler.

.IX Item "-e filename"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-exe=\fR\fIfilename\fR" 4
.IX Item "--exe=filename"

Specify the name of the executable for which addresses should be
translated.  The default file is \fIa.out\fR.
.IP "\fB\-f\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-functions\fR" 4
.IX Item "--functions"

.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-inlines\fR" 4
.IX Item "--inlines"
.PD
If the address belongs to a function that was inlined, the source
information for all enclosing scopes back to the first non-inlined
function will also be printed.  For example, if \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR inlines
\&\f(CW\*(C`callee1\*(C'\fR which inlines \f(CW\*(C`callee2\*(C'\fR, and address is from
\&\f(CW\*(C`callee2\*(C'\fR, the source information for \f(CW\*(C`callee1\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR
will also be printed.
.IP "\fB\-j\fR" 4
.IX Item "-j"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-section\fR" 4
.IX Item "--section"
.PD
Read offsets relative to the specified section instead of absolute addresses.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR" 4
.IX Item "-p"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-pretty\-print\fR" 4
.IX Item "--pretty-print"
.PD
Make the output more human friendly: each location are printed on one line.
If option \fB\-i\fR is specified, lines for all enclosing scopes are
prefixed with \fB(inlined by)\fR.
.IP "\fB@\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "@file"
Read command-line options from \fIfile\fR.  The options read are
inserted in place of the original @\fIfile\fR option.  If \fIfile\fR
does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
literally, and not removed.
.Sp
Options in \fIfile\fR are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
with a backslash.  The \fIfile\fR may itself contain additional
@\fIfile\fR options; any such options will be processed recursively.

The \s-1GNU\s0 \fBsize\fR utility lists the section sizes\-\-\-and the total

The command line options have the following meanings:
.IP "\fB\-A\fR" 4
.IX Item "-A"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-B\fR" 4
.IX Item "-B"
.IP "\fB\-\-format=\fR\fIcompatibility\fR" 4
.IX Item "--format=compatibility"
.PD
Using one of these options, you can choose whether the output from \s-1GNU\s0
\&\fBsize\fR resembles output from System V \fBsize\fR (using \fB\-A\fR,
or \fB\-\-format=sysv\fR), or Berkeley \fBsize\fR (using \fB\-B\fR, or
\&\fB\-\-format=berkeley\fR).  The default is the one-line format similar to
Berkeley's.
.Sp
Here is an example of the Berkeley (default) format of output from
\&\fBsize\fR:
.Sp

(\fB\-o\fR, or \fB\-\-radix=8\fR); or hexadecimal (\fB\-x\fR, or
\&\fB\-\-radix=16\fR).  In \fB\-\-radix=\fR\fInumber\fR, only the three
values (8, 10, 16) are supported.  The total size is always given in two
radices; decimal and hexadecimal for \fB\-d\fR or \fB\-x\fR output, or
octal and hexadecimal if you're using \fB\-o\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-common\fR" 4
