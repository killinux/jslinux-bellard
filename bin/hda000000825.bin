 if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!

Calc Enhancement Wish List:

    Send calc comments, suggestions, bug fixes, enhancements and
    interesting calc scripts that you would like you see included in
    future distributions to:

	    calc-contrib at asthe dot com

    The following items are in the calc wish list.  Programs like this
    can be extended and improved forever.

    Calc bug reports, however, should be sent to:

	    calc-bugs at asthe dot com

    [[ NOTE: Replace 'at' with @, 'dot' is with . and remove the spaces ]]
    [[ NOTE: The EMail address uses 'asthe' and the web site URL uses 'isthe' ]]

    See the 'todo' help file for higher priority todo items.

=-=

    *  In general use faster algorithms for large numbers when they
       become known.  In particular, look at better algorithms for
       very large numbers -- multiply, square and mod in particular.

    *  Implement an autoload feature.  Associate a calc resource filename
       with a function or global variable.  On the first reference of
       such item, perform an automatic load of that file.

    *  Add error handling statements, so that QUITs, errors from the
       'eval' function, division by zeroes, and so on can be caught.
       This should be done using syntax similar to:

		ONERROR statement DO statement;

       Something like signal isn't versatile enough.

    *  Add a debugging capability so that functions can be single stepped,
       breakpoints inserted, variables displayed, and so on.

    *  Figure out how to write all variables out to a file, including
       deeply nested arrays, lists, and objects.

       Add the ability to read and write a value in some binary form.
       Clearly this is easy for non-neg integers.  The question of
       everything else is worth pondering.

    *  Eliminate the need for the define keyword by doing smarter parsing.

    *  Allow results of a command (or all commands) to be re-directed to a
       file or piped into a command.

    *  Add some kind of #include and #define facility.	Perhaps use
       the C pre-processor itself?

    *  Support a more general input and output base mode other than
       just dec, hex or octal.

    *  Implement a form of symbolic algebra.  Work on this has already
       begun.  This will use backquotes to define expressions, and new
       functions will be able to act on expressions.  For example:

	    x = `hello * strlen(mom)`;
	    x = sub(x, `hello`, `hello + 1`);
	    x = sub(x, `hello`, 10, `mom`, "curds");
	    eval(x);

       prints 55.

    *  Place the results of previous commands into a parallel history list.
       Add a binding that returns the saved result of the command so
       that one does not need to re-execute a previous command simply
       to obtain its value.

       If you have a command that takes a very long time to execute,
       it would be nice if you could get at its result without having
       to spend the time to reexecute it.

    *  Add a binding to delete a value from the history list.

       One may need to remove a large value from the history list if
       it is very large.  Deleting the value would replace the history
       entry with a null value.

    *  Add a binding to delete a command from the history list.

       Since you can delete values, you might as well be able to
       delete commands.

    *  All one to alter the size of the history list thru config().

       In some cases, 256 values is too small, in others it is too large.

    *  Add a builtin that returns a value from the history list.
       As an example:

	    histval(-10)

       returns the 10th value on the history value list, if such
       a value is in the history list (null otherwise).	 And:

	    histval(23)

       return the value of the 23rd command given to calc, if
       such a value is in the history list (null otherwise).

       It would be very helpful to use the history values in
       subsequent equations.

    *  Add a builtin that returns command as a string from the
       history list.  As an example:

	    history(-10)

       returns a string containing the 10th command on the
       history list, if a such a value is in the history list
       (empty string otherwise).  And:

	    history(23)

       return the string containing the 23rd command given to calc, if
       such a value is in the history list (empty string otherwise).

       One could use the eval() function to re-evaluate the command.

    *  Allow one to optionally restore the command number to calc
       prompts.	 When going back in the history list, indicate the
       command number that is being examined.

       The command number was a useful item.  When one is scanning the
       history list, knowing where you are is hard without it.	It can
       get confusing when the history list wraps or when you use
       search bindings.	 Command numbers would be useful in
       conjunction with positive args for the history() and histval()
       functions as suggested above.

    *  Add a builtin that returns the current command number.
       For example:

	    cmdnum()

       returns the current command number.

       This would allow one to tag a value in the history list.	 One
       could save the result of cmdnum() in a variable and later use
       it as an arg to the histval() or history() functions.

    *  Add a factoring builtin functions.  Provide functions that perform
       multiple polynomial quadratic sieves, elliptic curve, difference
       of two squares, N-1 factoring as so on.	Provide a easy general
       factoring builtin (say factor(foo)) that would attempt to apply
       whatever process was needed based on the value.

       Factoring builtins would return a matrix of factors.

       It would be handy to configure, via config(), the maximum time
       that one should try to factor a number.	By default the time
       should be infinite.  If one set the time limit to a finite
       value and the time limit was exceeded, the factoring builtin
       would return whatever if had found thus far, even if no new
       factors had been found.

       Another factoring configuration interface, via config(), that
       is needed would be to direct the factoring builtins to return
       as soon as a factor was found.

    *  Allow one to config calc break up long output lines.

       The command:  calc '2^100000'  will produce one very long
       line.  Many times this is reasonable.  Long output lines
       are a problem for some utilities.  It would be nice if one
       could configure, via config(), calc to fold long lines.

       By default, calc should continue to produce long lines.

       One option to config should be to specify the length to
       fold output.  Another option should be to append a trailing
       \ on folded lines (as some symbolic packages use).

    *  Allow one to use the READ and WRITE commands inside a function.

    *  Remove or increase limits on factor(), lfactor(), isprime(),
       nextprime(), and prevprime().  Currently these functions cannot
       search for factors > 2^32.

    *  Add read -once -try "filename" which would do nothing
       if "filename" was not a readable file.

Calc Todo Items:

    The following items should be addressed sometime in the short to
    medium term future, if not before the next release.

    Code contributions are welcome.  Send patches to:

	    calc-contrib at asthe dot com

    Calc bug reports, however, should send to:

	    calc-bugs at asthe dot com

    [[ NOTE: Replace 'at' with @, 'dot' is with . and remove the spaces ]]
    [[ NOTE: The EMail address uses 'asthe' and the web site URL uses 'isthe' ]]

    See the BUGS file or try the calc command:

	    help bugs

    See also the 'wishlist' help files for the calc enhancement wish list.

=-=

Very High priority items:

    * Improve the way that calc parses statements such as if, for, while
      and do so that when a C programmer does.  This works as expected:

	    if (expr) {
		...
	    }

      However this WILL NOT WORK AS EXPECTED:

	    if (expr)
	    {
		...
	    }

      because calc will parse the if being terminated by
      an empty statement followed by a

	    if (expr) ;
	    {
		...
	    }

      See also "help statement", "help unexpected", "help todo", and
      "help bugs".

    * Consider using GNU autoconf / configure to build calc.

    * It is overkill to have nearly everything wind up in libcalc.
      Form a libcalcmath and a libcalclang so that an application
      that just wants to link with the calc math libs can use them
      without dragging in all of the other calc language, I/O,
      and builtin functions.

    * Fix any 'Known bugs' as noted in the BUGS file or as
      displayed by 'calc help bugs'.

=-=

High priority items:

    * Verify, complete or fix the 'SEE ALSO' help file sections.

    * Verify, complete or fix the 'LINK LIBRARY' help file sections.

    * Verify, complete or fix the 'LIMITS' help file sections.

    * Verify, complete or fix the 'SYNOPSIS' and 'TYPES' help file sections.

    * Perform a code coverage analysis of the 'make check' action
      and improve the coverage (within reason) of the regress.cal suite.

    * Address, if possible and reasonable, any Calc Mis-features
      as noted in the BUGS file or as displayed by 'calc help bugs'.

    * Internationalize calc by converting calc error messages and
      text strings (e.g., calc startup banner, show output, etc.)
      into calls to the GNU gettext internationalization facility.
      If somebody translated these strings into another language,
      setting $LANG would allow calc to produce error messages
      and text strings in that language.

=-=

Medium priority items:

    * Complete the use of CONST where appropriate:

	CONST is beginning to be used with read-only tables and some
	function arguments.  This allows certain compilers to better
	optimize the code as well as alerts one to when some value
	is being changed inappropriately.  Use of CONST as in:

	    int foo(CONST int curds, char *CONST whey)

	while legal C is not as useful because the caller is protected
	by the fact that args are passed by value.  However, the
	in the following:

	    int bar(CONST char *fizbin, CONST HALF *data)

	is useful because it calls the compiler that the string pointed
	at by 'fizbin' and the HALF array pointer at by 'data' should be
	treated as read-only.

      One should make available a the fundamental math operations
      on ZVALUE, NUMBER and perhaps COMPLEX (without all of the
      other stuff) in a separate library.

    * Clean the source code and document it better.

    * Add a builtin function to access the 64 bit FNV hash which
      is currently being used internally in seed.c.

    ftell - return a file position

SYNOPSIS
    ftell(fd)

TYPES
    fd		open file stream

    return	non-negative integer or error value

DESCRIPTION
    This function attempts to return the current value of the file position
    indicator for the stream.  This is the number of characters (bytes)
    between the beginning of the file and the position of the
    next character for output in "w" or "w+" mode or for input.

     On failure, this returns an error value.

EXAMPLE
    ; fd = fopen("/tmp/curds", "w")
    ; fputs(fd, "0123456789")
    ; ftell(fd)
	10
    ; fputs(fd, "abcdef")
    ; ftell(fd)
	16
    ; fseek(fd, 20, 0)
    ; ftell(fd)
	20
    ; fputs(fd, "01234")
    ; ftell(fd)
	25
    ; freopen(fd, "r")
    ; fscanf(fd, "%*5c")
	0
    ; ftell(fd)

    power - evaluate a numerical power to specified accuracy

SYNOPSIS
    power(x, y, [, eps])

TYPES
    x		number
    x		number
    eps		nonzero real, defaults to epsilon()

    return	number

DESCRIPTION
    For real or complex x and y, power(x,y,eps) returns a real or
    complex number for which the real and imaginary parts are multiples
    of epsilon differing from the true real and imaginary parts of the
    principal y-th power of x by less than 0.75 * abs(eps), usually by
    less than 0.5 * abs(eps).  If the principal y-th power of x is a
    multiple of eps, it will be returned exactly.

    If y is a large integer but x^y is not large, and accuracy
    represented by eps is all that is required, power(x,y,eps) may be
    considerably faster than appr(x^y, eps, 24), the difference between
    the two results being probably at most abs(eps).

EXAMPLE
    ; print power(1.2345, 10, 1e-5), power(1.2345, 10, 1e-10)
    8.22074 8.2207405646

    ; print power(1+3i, 3, 1e-5), power(1 + 3i, 2+ 1i, 1e-5)
    -26-18i -2.50593-1.39445i

    ; print power(1+ 1e-30, 1e30, 1e-20)
    2.71828182845904523536

    ; print power(1i, 1i, 1e-20)
    .20787957635076190855

    ; print power(exp(1, 1e-20), pi(1e-20) * 1i/2, 1e-20)
    1i

LIMITS
    If x = 0, y in power(x,y,eps) has to have positive real part,
    except in the case of y = 0; power(0, 0, eps) is the multiple of
    eps nearest 1.

    eps > 0

Calc's relationship to the GNU Lesser General Public License
------------------------------------------------------------

    In section 0 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, one finds
    the following definition:

	The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or
	work which has been distributed under these terms.

    Calc is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser
    General Public License.

    In the same section 0, one also find the following:

	For a library, complete source code means all the source code
	for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
	definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
	and installation of the library.

    There are at least two calc binary link libraries found in calc:

	libcalc.a	libcustcalc.a

    Clearly all files that go into the creation of those binary link
    libraries are covered under the License.

    The ``scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
    of the library'' include:

	* Makefiles
	* source files created by the Makefiles
	* source code used in the creation of intermediate source files

     All of those files are covered under the License.

     The ``associated interface definition files'' are those files that:

	* show how the calc binary link libraries are used
	* test the validity of the binary link libraries
	* document routines found in the binary link libraries
	* show how one can interactively use the binary link libraries

     Calc provides an extensive set of files that perform the above
     functions.

	* files under the sample sub-directory
	* files under the help sub-directory
	* files under the lib sub-directory
	* the main calc.c file

     The ``complete source code'' includes ALL files shipped with calc,
     except for the exception files explicitly listed in the ``Calc
     copyrights and exception files'' section below.

Why calc did not use the GNU General Public License
---------------------------------------------------

    It has been suggested that one should consider using the GNU General
    Public License instead of the GNU Lesser General Public License:

	http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html

    As you can read in the above URL, there are times where a library
    cannot give free software any particular advantage.	 One of those
    times is when there is significantly similar versions available
    that are not covered under a Copyleft such as the GNU General Public
    License.

    The reason why calc was placed under the GNU Lesser General Public
    License is because for many years (1984 thru 1999), calc was offered
    without any form of Copyleft.  At the time calc was placed under
    the GNU Lesser General Public License, a number of systems and
    distributions distributed calc without a Copyleft.

    modify - modify a list or matrix by changing the values of its elements

SYNOPSIS
    modify(A, fname)

TYPES
    A		lvalue with list, matrix or objectvalue
    fname	string, the name of a user-defined function

    return	null value if successful, otherwise an error value

DESCRIPTION
    The value of each element of A is replaced by the value at that
    value of the user-defined function with name fname. Thus,
    modify(A, "f") has the effect of

	for (i = 0; i < size(A); i++) A[[i]] = f(A[[i]]);

    An error value is returned if A is not of acceptable type, if A has
    no-change protection, or if there is no user-defined function with
    name fname. The assignments are executed even if the protection
    status of some elements A[[i]] would normally prevent the
    assignment of f(A[[i]]) to A[[i]]. The modified elements retain
    whatever kinds of protection they had as well as gaining any
    other kinds of protection in the values returned by the function.

    To obtain a modified copy of A without changing values in A,
    one may use

	Amod = A; modify(A, fname)

    or more simply

	modify(Amod = A, fname).

EXAMPLE
    ; define f(x) = x^2
    ; A = list(2,4,6)
    ; modify(A, "f")
    ; print A

    list (3 elements, 3 nonzero):
	  [[0]] = 4
	  [[1]] = 16
	  [[3]] = 36

    fpathopen - open an absolute filename, or a relative filename along a search path

SYNOPSIS
    fpathopen(filename, mode [,searchpath])

TYPES
    filename	string
    mode	string
    searchpath	string

    return	file

DESCRIPTION
    This function opens the file named filename, potentially searching
    for the file along a search path given by searchpath.  If searchpath
    is not given, then CALCPATH search path is used.

    If the filename is absolute, or it has an implied path, then
    searchpath is ignored and the filename is opened directly.
    Absolute filenames, and filenames with an implied path are files
    that begin with:

    	/	# absolute path
	./	# implied path through the current working directory
	../	# implied path through the current working directory parent
	~	# absolute path going through a home directory

    A search path is a :-separated list of directories used to search for
    a filename.  For example:

    	fpathopen("whey", "r", ".:/tmp:/var/tmp:~chongo/pub:~/tmp");

    will cause this function to open the first readable file it
    files while searching through these paths in order:

    	./whey
	/tmp/whey
	/var/tmp/whey
	~chongo/pub/whey
	~/tmp/whey

    IMPORTANT NOTE:

    This function searches along a path by attempting
    to open files under the given mode.  If the mode allows for
    writing and a file can be created, then that file is returned.

    This call open "./gleet" for writing if the current directory is
    writable, even if "./gleet" did not previously exist:

    	fpathopen("gleet", "r", ".:/tmp:/var/tmp:~chongo/pub:~/tmp");

    This call will likely open (and create if needded) for appending,
    the file "/tmp/log" assuming that the user is not allowed to
    create files in the previous system directories:

    	fpathopen("log", "a", "/:/etc:/bin:/usr/bin:/tmp");

    The CALCPATH search path is taken from the $CALCPATH environment
    variable or if no such variable exists, a compiled in default search
    path is used.  See "help environment" and "help calcpath" for more
    information on CALCPATH.

    It should be noted that while CALCPATH is typically used to find
    resource files (*.cal files), this function is not restricted those
    files.  Any filename may be opened.

    A file can be opened for either reading, writing, or appending.
    The mode is controlled by the mode flag as follows:

		 allow	  allow    file is   positioned	  file(*)
       mode	reading	 writing  truncated      at	  mode
       ----	-------  -------  ---------  ---------	  ----
	r	   Y	    N	      N      beginning	  text
	rb	   Y	    N	      N      beginning	  binary
	r+	   Y	    N	      N      beginning	  text
	r+b	   Y	    N	      N      beginning	  binary
	rb+	   Y	    N	      N      beginning	  binary

	w	   N	    Y	      Y      beginning	  text
	wb	   N	    Y	      Y      beginning	  binary
	w+	   Y	    Y	      Y      beginning	  text
	w+b	   Y	    Y	      Y      beginning	  binary
	wb+	   Y	    Y	      Y      beginning	  binary

	a	   N	    Y	      Y         end	  text
	ab	   N	    Y	      Y         end	  binary
	a+	   Y	    Y	      Y         end	  text
	a+b	   Y	    Y	      Y         end	  binary
	ab+	   Y	    Y	      Y         end	  binary

    (*) NOTE on 'b' / binary/text mode:

    	The 'b' or fopen binary mode has no effect on POSIX / Linux
	/ Un*x-like systems.  On those systems a text file is the
	same as a binary file (as it should be for any modern-day
	operating system).  Adding 'b' to an fopen has no effect
	and is ignored.

	Some non-POSIX systems sucn as MS Windoz treat text files
	and binary files differently.  In text mode MS Windoz consider
	"\r\n" and end-of-line character.  On an Apple MAC, the
	text mode end-of-line character is "\r".

    Names of files are subject to ~ expansion just like the C or
    Korn shell.	 For example, the file name:

	~/lib/gleet

    refers to the file 'gleet' under the directory lib located
    in your home directory.  The file name:

	~chongo/was_here

    refers to the a file 'was_here' under the home directory of
    the user 'chongo'.

    If the open is successful, a value of type 'file' will be returned.
    You can use the 'isfile' function to test the return value to see
    if the open succeeded.  You should assign the return value of fopen
    to a variable for later use.  File values can be copied to more than
    one variable, and using any of the variables with the same file value
    will produce the same results.

    Standard input, standard output and standard error are always opened
    and cannot be closed.

    The truth value of an opened file is TRUE.

    If the open is unsuccessful, the numeric value of errno is returned.
    You can the errno() builtin to determine what the errno number means.

    ; fd = fpathopen("motd", "r", "/etc:.")
    ; print fd
    "/etc/motd"

SYNOPSIS
    hnrmod(v, h, n, r)

TYPES
    v		integer
    h		integer
    n		integer
    r		integer

    return	integer

DESCRIPTION
    Compute the value:

    where:

	h > 0
	n > 0
	r == -1, 0 or 1

    This builtin in faster than the standard mod in that is makes use
    of shifts and additions when h == 1.  When h > 1, a division by h
    is also needed.
